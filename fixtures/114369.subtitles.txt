1
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,072
They were screaming at each other
for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,392
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,113
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,592
Yeah.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,034
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,834
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,393
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,197
What?

9
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,917
The kid.

10
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,473
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,315
We'll be glad to
get rid of you, Somerset.

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,354
Always these questions.

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,558
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,550
He's dead.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,916
His wife killed him.
The rest is nothing to do with us.

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,195
Detective Somerset?

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,034
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,672
I get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,630
Look...

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,197
Mills?

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
Let's find a bar,
sit and talk...

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,351
I'd like to get to the precinct.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,034
Not much time for
this transition thing.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

25
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,917
Yeah?

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
- Why here?
- I don't follow.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,748
All this effort
to get transferred.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,474
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,393
Same reasons as you,

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,513
or the reasons you had
before you decided to quit.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,393
You just met me.

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
Maybe I don't understand
the question.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,149
It's very simple.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,590
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,030
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,239
Be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,350
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,798
I want you to look
and listen, okay?

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,914
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I worked homicide 5 years.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,878
- Not here.
- I understand.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,874
Over the next 7 days,
do me a favor and remember that.

42
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,838
Yeah. Okay.

43
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,709
Say it again?

44
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,514
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

45
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,998
Serpico's got to go.

46
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,274
You might want to get rid of...

47
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,750
this crusty. This eye, Serpico.

48
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,479
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

49
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,351
Good.

50
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,075
Coffee? No?

51
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,238
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

52
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,993
What time was death established?

53
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,514
Like I said,

54
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,153
I didn't touch anything,

55
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,389
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

56
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,471
No one bothers with vital signs?

57
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,075
Did I stutter?

58
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,551
He ain't breathing unless
he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

59
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,718
- That's how it's done around here?
- I beg your pardon, Detective,

60
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,713
but the guy's sitting in a pile
of his own piss and shit.

61
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,837
If he wasn't dead,
he would have stood up by now.

62
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,758
- Alright.
- Thank you, officer.

63
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,357
Thank you.

64
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,150
I wonder...

65
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,674
what was the point
of that conversation?

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,671
I don't know.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,595
How many times Barney Five found
dead bodies that weren't dead?

68
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,116
Drop it.

69
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,551
Phone Guinness.
I think we got a record here.

70
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,991
Better Homes and Gardens.

71
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,998
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,117
No one.

73
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,993
Guy's heart must be

74
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,559
the size of a canned ham.

75
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,432
If this isn't a coronary,

76
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,437
well,

77
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,350
I don't know.

78
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,631
Whoops.

79
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,594
How about that?

80
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,518
We had this case once,

81
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,351
guy dead on the ground,

82
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,192
knife in his back.

83
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,429
Murder, right?

84
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,391
Fuck.

85
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,118
Big insurance policy involved.

86
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,152
Guy took the tip of the blade,

87
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,510
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades.

88
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,433
He must have screwed up
because there were...

89
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,472
...multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,156
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,077
What?

92
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,599
We got a bucket here.

93
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,796
What's in it?

94
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,031
My God!

95
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,999
Fucking vomit!

96
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,515
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,555
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,511
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,477
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,639
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,758
You girls have got
forensics waiting outside.

102
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,348
We might not fit.

103
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,989
There's room.
Light's the problem.

104
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,996
How are you?

105
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,151
Detective Mills,
go help the officers

106
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,833
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,152
What?

108
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,272
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,315
He's dead.

110
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,315
Thank you, doctor.

111
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,675
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,552
Nope.

113
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,712
I did door-to-doors,
walked the beat, all that shit...

114
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,228
a long time.

115
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,673
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
"detective", same as yours.

117
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,792
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
I had to consider
the integrity of the crime scene,

119
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,477
not whether you were getting
enough time in the field.

120
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,471
Hey, man...

121
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,990
Just don't jerk me off.
That's all I ask.

122
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,269
He's been dead...

123
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,159
a long time,
and not from poison.

124
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,037
Oh, man.

125
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,630
How can you
let yourself go like this?

126
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,958
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

127
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,393
How'd the fat fuck
fit out his door?

128
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,272
It's obvious he was a shut-in.

129
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,830
See how big this stomach is?

130
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,032
Strange thing is, it stretches.

131
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,677
Look, the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

132
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,354
I see that,
but it means nothing to me.

133
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,556
He's got lines of distention

134
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,199
across the duodenum.

135
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,919
The interior wall's ripped open.

136
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,471
This man ate till he burst?

137
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,428
No, he didn't burst all the way.

138
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,636
He was hemorrhaging internally.

139
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,348
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

140
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,433
...the abdominal muscles.
- He did die by eating?

141
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,476
Yes and no.

142
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,598
What about these bruises here?

143
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,158
I haven't figured that out yet.

144
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,112
Gun pressed against his head?

145
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,594
Pressed hard enough.

146
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,630
Fuck, yeah.

147
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,840
On the front,
flush with the muzzle.

148
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,718
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a homicide.

149
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,834
Killer put a bucket under him.
Took his time, too.

150
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,919
Coroner said
it could've lasted 12 hours.

151
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,237
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort,

152
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,119
and there was a point
when he passed out.

153
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,271
That's when the killer kicked him,

154
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,238
...and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

155
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,233
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

156
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,835
You don't risk
the time it takes for this,

157
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,231
unless the act itself
has meaning.

158
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,559
Somebody had a problem with
a fat boy and tortured him. Simple.

159
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,955
In the grocer bags,

160
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,630
we found two receipts.
So the killer went back...

161
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,108
to the supermarket.

162
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,437
So?

163
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,437
It's his thing.
I've been out in the rain.

164
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,432
- This is a beginning.
- We've got...

165
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,272
one dead guy, not three.

166
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,430
No motive.

167
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,950
Don't start
that big brain of yours...

168
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,713
cooking on this, alright?

169
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,037
I'd like to be reassigned.

170
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,237
Whoa!

171
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,271
What are you talking about?

172
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,835
This can't be my last duty.

173
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,149
It'll go on and on.

174
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,790
You're retiring in 6 days.

175
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,873
You've left
unfinished business before.

176
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,948
The cases were taken
as close as possible to conclusion.

177
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,910
- May I speak freely?
- We're friends here.

178
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,559
It shouldn't be his first case.

179
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,594
I knew it. It's not
my first assignment, you dick.

180
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,829
It's too soon for him.

181
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,072
You can say that shit
to my face. Captain?

182
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,389
It's too soon for you.

183
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,111
Captain,

184
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,397
can we talk in private?

185
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,868
This is a personal thing...

186
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,509
Just shut up, Mills.

187
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,398
I don't have anyone else

188
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,677
to put on this.
This is Metro.

189
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,673
- You don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

190
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,717
What?

191
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,236
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

192
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,276
Give it to me.

193
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,272
I'll put you on something else.

194
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,791
Go on, Mills, just go on.

195
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,718
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck

196
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,473
cleaning up the fat man.

197
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,195
Quiet down.

198
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,715
Alright, calm down, calm down.

199
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,156
Quiet down.

200
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,548
Here's how it'll work:

201
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,675
I'll answer questions
for 10 minutes only.

202
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,279
Ask those questions in a calm,
orderly fashion, or I will leave.

203
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,393
Detective?

204
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,392
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

205
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,034
I won't discuss the details
of this investigation,

206
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,111
so don't bother asking.

207
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,028
- What you got for me?
- Nothing yet, boss.

208
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,713
Why don't you guys
go get a coffee?

209
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,069
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown, where attorney,

210
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,749
Eli Gould,
was found murdered today.

211
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,999
DA Martin Talbot is taking
questions from reporters.

212
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,231
That's ridiculous and offensive.

213
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,437
There is no conflict,

214
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,274
and any claim there could be
is irresponsible.

215
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,151
Now hold on.

216
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,510
I just met with
law enforcement officials,

217
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,833
and they have
their very best men on this.

218
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,875
This will be the definition

219
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,434
of swift justice.

220
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,469
Pardon me, George.

221
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,071
- Somerset...
- Come in.

222
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,834
You heard the news?

223
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,354
Nope, haven't heard.

224
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,114
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

225
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,796
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

226
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,670
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

227
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,350
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

228
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,037
Mills is heading the investigation.

229
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,394
Excuse me.

230
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,835
Don't do that, please?

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,228
Good for him.

232
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,995
What will you do...

233
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,151
with yourself out there, Somerset?

234
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,312
I'll work maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

235
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,788
Don't you feel it?

236
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,118
Don't you feel that feeling?

237
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,955
You won't be a cop anymore.

238
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,833
That's the whole idea.

239
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,074
I don't think you'll leave.

240
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,791
You can't leave all this.

241
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,032
Guy's out walking his dog.

242
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,275
Gets attacked.

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,270
His watch is taken, his wallet.

244
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,868
And while he's lying on
the sidewalk,

245
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,633
helpless,

246
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,920
his attacker stabs him
in both eyes.

247
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,159
This happened last night,
four blocks from here.

248
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,990
I read about it.

249
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,678
I don't understand anymore.

250
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,713
It's the way it's always been.

251
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,516
- Maybe you're right.
- You were made for this work.

252
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,717
You can't deny that.

253
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,109
Maybe I'm wrong.

254
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,596
Coroner sent this for you.

255
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,875
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach,

256
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,232
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces...

257
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,072
...of plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

258
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,229
They were...

259
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,829
fed to him.

260
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,111
Lord.

261
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,353
This was found behind the fridge
in the obesity murder scene.

262
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,438
"Long is the way,

263
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,553
and hard, that out of Hell
leads up to the light."

264
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,670
It's from Milton.

265
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,119
"Paradise Lost"

266
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,317
Alright,

267
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,629
I'm confused.

268
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,951
It means that
this is a beginning.

269
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,512
This was behind the fridge,

270
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,751
written in grease.

271
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,956
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

272
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,390
Gluttony,

273
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,111
greed,

274
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,471
sloth, wrath,

275
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,637
pride, lust,

276
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,355
and envy.

277
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,957
Seven.

278
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,558
Hold on.

279
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,551
This is not even my desk.

280
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,032
You can expect 5 more of these.

281
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,355
Wait a minute.

282
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,757
I can't get involved in this.

283
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,910
Somerset.

284
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,879
He wanted it.

285
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,351
Damn!

286
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,199
I'm all over it.

287
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,837
Where to?

288
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,832
Far away from here.

289
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,916
- A few things to look up.
- Okay.

290
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,633
Sit where you like.

291
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,316
How's everybody?

292
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,909
Hiya, Smiley.

293
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,076
George, cards are getting cold.

294
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,674
Duty calls.

295
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,110
Gentlemen.

296
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,629
I'll never understand.

297
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,639
All these books,

298
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,996
a world of knowledge,

299
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,516
and what do you do?
Play poker all night.

300
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,757
We got culture.

301
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,998
We got culture
coming out our asses.

302
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,677
How's this for culture?

303
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,995
You know, Smiley...

304
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,798
you'll really miss us.

305
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,675
I just might.

306
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,515
Fucking Dante.

307
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,797
Goddamn poetry-writing
faggot piece of shit.

308
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,557
Fucker.

309
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,153
Good work, officer.

310
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,115
Thank you, Lord.

311
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,235
Oh, sorry.

312
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,759
I'll move in a second.

313
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,269
- You want your chair?
- No, you go ahead.

314
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,032
Yeah?

315
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,231
Phone.

316
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,835
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

317
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,351
Mills.

318
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,030
Honey. You okay?
Something wrong?

319
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,154
Dingleberry. I told you
not to call when I'm at work.

320
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,355
Yeah. Why?

321
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,637
Why?

322
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,916
Why?

323
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,671
Okay.

324
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,075
It's my wife.

325
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,197
Sorry?

326
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,479
She'd like to speak to you.

327
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,958
This is Detective Somerset.

328
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,519
Yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

329
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,190
I appreciate the offer, but...

330
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,916
In that case, I'd be delighted.

331
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,678
Yes, thank you very much.

332
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,677
Bye.

333
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,516
Honey, what...?

334
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,197
Well?

335
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,388
- Sorry?
- What?

336
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,388
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

337
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,557
At my... how's that?

338
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,831
Tonight.

339
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,068
Hello, men.

340
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,954
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

341
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,835
That's Tracy.

342
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,397
Hello.

343
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,555
Happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

344
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,592
Except your first name.

345
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,110
It's William.

346
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,831
Well, it's a good name.

347
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,677
William.

348
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,791
I'd like you to meet David.

349
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,237
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

350
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,599
- How are the kids?
- Good, they're in the room.

351
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,795
Good dogs.

352
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,834
Good dogs.
How are you, pretty?

353
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,233
- Smells good.
- What?

354
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,872
Yeah. I mean, thanks.

355
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,238
Please have a seat, if you like.

356
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,870
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'll wait.

357
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,912
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

358
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,792
We're still unpacking.

359
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,674
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

360
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,670
Pretty hokey, huh?

361
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,390
You know something?

362
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,875
From the first date,
I knew he was...

363
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,434
...the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

364
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,159
He was the funniest guy
I'd ever met.

365
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,431
Really.

366
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,876
It's kind of rare nowadays.

367
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,311
I mean, that level...

368
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,231
of commitment.

369
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,950
Don't worry.

370
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,598
I won't wear it to the table.

371
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,911
You know,

372
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,515
no matter how often I see guns,

373
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,710
I can't get used to them.

374
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,956
Same here.

375
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,589
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy...

376
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,836
What the hell...?

377
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,753
I was close once.

378
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,955
It just didn't happen.

379
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,633
It surprises me.

380
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,390
It really does.

381
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,991
Well...

382
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,428
anyone who spends much time
with me finds me disagreeable.

383
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,999
Just ask your husband.

384
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,831
Very true.

385
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,919
Very, very true.

386
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,957
How long have you lived here?

387
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,517
Too long.

388
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,788
How do you like it?

389
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,516
You know,

390
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,271
takes time. Settle in,

391
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,629
it'll be good.

392
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,431
You get numb after a while.

393
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,596
There are things to any city.

394
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,916
Subway.

395
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,437
It'll go away in a minute.

396
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,031
Real estate guy.

397
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,795
Fucking piece of... sorry honey.

398
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,797
Shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

399
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,508
He's efficient.
Trace really likes it.

400
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,794
Then we wonder why he only
brings us here for 5 minutes.

401
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,912
We found out the first night.

402
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,470
The soothing, relaxing...

403
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,519
vibrating home.

404
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,790
I'm sorry.

405
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,958
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

406
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,717
I don't know why you're laughing.

407
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,994
Alright, already.

408
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,117
He had to get into the building

409
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,515
before the office closed.

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,194
- Gould would've been working late.
- I'm certain.

411
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,351
The biggest defense lawyer
in town. Infamous, really.

412
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,558
The body was found
on Tuesday morning.

413
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,799
The office was closed Monday.
He could've gotten in Friday,

414
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,953
laid low till the cleaners left,
then had his way

415
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,397
with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

416
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,671
Look.

417
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,358
Gould was bound, right arm free.

418
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,557
He was handed a butcher's knife.

419
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,552
- Check out the scale.
- A pound of flesh.

420
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,349
"One pound of flesh,

421
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,670
no more, no less.
No cartilage,

422
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,710
no bone,

423
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,430
only flesh."
"Merchant of Venice"

424
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,550
Didn't see it.

425
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,957
"This task done,
and he would go free."

426
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,839
That chair was...

427
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,275
...soaked with sweat.
- Of course.

428
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,953
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time,

429
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,118
deciding which cut

430
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,674
to make first.

431
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,029
Imagine it.

432
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,158
There's a gun in your face.

433
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,309
Which part of your body
is expendable?

434
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,475
The love handle.

435
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,148
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

436
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,668
Let's take a fresh look.
The corpse is there, but...

437
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,072
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

438
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,232
The trick is to find
one item, one detail...

439
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,879
and focus on it...

440
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,390
till it's an exhausted possibility.

441
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,398
I'll get another beer. Beer?

442
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,869
Wine, please.

443
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,119
He's preaching.

444
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,470
Punishing.

445
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,991
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

446
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,556
7 cardinal virtues, 7 deadly sins,

447
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,752
...used as teaching tools.
- Yeah, like in...

448
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,396
- "The Parson's Tale" and Dante.
- You read them?

449
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,117
Yeah.

450
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,909
Parts.
Remember in "Purgatory"

451
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,798
Dante and his buddy
climb up...

452
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,429
the hill and check out
the sinners?

453
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,671
The 7 Terraces of Purgation.

454
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,636
Yeah, right.

455
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,232
But there, pride comes first,
not gluttony.

456
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,839
Let's consider the books

457
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,548
as the killer's inspiration.

458
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,758
The sermons were about
atonement for sin.

459
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,036
These murders are like
forced attrition.

460
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,357
Forced what?

461
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,718
Attrition's when you
regret your sins...

462
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,549
...but not for love of God.
- Because of a gun in your face.

463
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,315
No fingerprints.

464
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,317
No.

465
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,468
Totally unrelated victims.

466
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,475
And no witnesses.

467
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,988
Which I don't get...

468
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,039
because the fucker
had to get back out.

469
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,675
In a major city,
minding your business is a science.

470
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,310
In rape prevention, they tell you
never to cry for help.

471
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,473
Always yell "fire!"

472
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,948
Nobody answers "help".

473
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,997
Holler "fire", they'll come.

474
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,389
That's fucked up.

475
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,031
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

476
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,468
Thanks for talking this out,
but I got to sleep.

477
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,068
I got to walk the dogs.

478
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,595
This is just to satisfy
my curiosity.

479
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,475
- I'm leaving the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

480
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,919
Gould's wife was out of town.

481
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,118
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

482
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,188
I put her in a safehouse.
She wasn't happy about it.

483
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,075
What if it isn't
what she's seen,

484
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,234
but what she's supposed to
and hasn't yet?

485
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,869
Yeah, okay. What?

486
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,077
I don't know.

487
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,152
But that's the one thing.

488
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,750
I'll sign us in.

489
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,472
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

490
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,391
Mrs. Gould?

491
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,190
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

492
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,592
I don't understand.

493
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,435
I need you to look at each photo

494
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,434
very carefully.

495
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,992
See if anything's strange,

496
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,709
out of place, anything at all.

497
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,869
I don't see anything.

498
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,717
You're sure?

499
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,190
Please,
I can't do this right now.

500
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,157
Okay.

501
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,999
It's got to be now.

502
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,753
Maybe we missed something.

503
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,752
Wait.

504
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,872
What?

505
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Here.

506
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,115
This painting, it's upside down.

507
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,877
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

508
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,594
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

509
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,397
Nothing.

510
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,718
There's got to be something.

511
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,755
He moved the screws
to re-hang it.

512
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,275
What the fuck is that?

513
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,514
Switchblade.

514
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,316
Goddamn it.

515
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,998
There must be something.

516
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,198
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

517
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,754
No, he's fucking with us.

518
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,117
See this, this is us.

519
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,069
Just wait a minute.

520
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,118
- Somerset's climbing furniture.
- Wait a minute.

521
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,199
You're kidding me.

522
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,114
Call the print lab.

523
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,316
Oh, man.

524
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,990
Honestly...

525
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,029
have you ever seen
anything like this?

526
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,672
No.

527
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,320
The swell pattern tells me
they're not...

528
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,357
the victim's prints.

529
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,312
I say he's whacked enough.

530
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,429
It doesn't fit.

531
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,633
He doesn't want to stop.

532
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,716
Who knows.

533
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,789
Freaks doing their evil deeds
they don't want to.

534
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,355
"Voices made me do it."
"My dog made me do it."

535
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,232
"Jodie Foster told me to do it."

536
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,749
It can take...

537
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,675
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to...

538
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,478
cross your fingers somewhere else.

539
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,758
You meant what you said
to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

540
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,235
- About catching this guy.
- Yeah.

541
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,275
Wish I still thought
the way you do.

542
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,071
What the hell
do you think we're doing?

543
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,319
Picking up the pieces.

544
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,039
Collecting evidence,
taking pictures and samples,

545
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,797
writing everything down,

546
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,150
noting the times things happened.

547
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,396
That's all?

548
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,796
That's all.

549
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,957
Putting everything into
neat piles...

550
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,997
and filing it, on the off chance
it'll be needed in a courtroom.

551
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,911
Picking up diamonds
on a desert island,

552
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,720
saving them in case
we get rescued.

553
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,790
Bullshit.

554
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,194
Even the most promising clues
only lead to others.

555
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,348
So many corpses roll away,
unrevenged.

556
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,230
Don't tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

557
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,070
I saw you.

558
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,437
We're getting somewhere.

559
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,793
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

560
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,508
We got a winner.

561
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,195
He uses the name Victor.
Real name: Theodore Allen.

562
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,113
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

563
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,392
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

564
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,029
He got a very strict,
Southern Baptist upbringing.

565
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,314
Somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

566
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,757
Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

567
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,912
Spent time in prison
for attempted rape of a minor.

568
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,118
His lawyer made sure
that didn't last long.

569
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,750
By the way, the lawyer was
Eli Gould, the "greed" victim.

570
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,031
We're finishing this today,
ladies and germs.

571
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,108
Victor's been out of circulation,
but we have a residence for him.

572
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,868
- You're not buying this.
- Doesn't seem like...

573
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,759
...our guy, does it?
- You tell me.

574
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,910
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

575
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,948
You ever take a bullet?

576
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,118
Never in my 34 years.
Knock wood.

577
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,279
I've only taken my gun out

578
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,590
three times,
intending to use it.

579
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,393
Never pulled the trigger.

580
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,669
Not once.

581
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,037
You?

582
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,751
No, I never took a bullet,
but...

583
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,713
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

584
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,831
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

585
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,957
We were a secondary unit.

586
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,993
I was shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

587
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,312
We bust open a door,
looking for this junkie,

588
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,913
and he opened fire on us.

589
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,832
One cop got hit in the arm.

590
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,319
What was his name?

591
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,319
It spun him like a top.
Well, more like slow motion.

592
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,715
I remember

593
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,074
riding in that ambulance...

594
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,196
and well...

595
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,068
he died right there.

596
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,276
Right there.

597
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,431
What was his fucking name?

598
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,954
SWAT goes before dicks.

599
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,475
They love this.

600
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,471
Police!

601
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,431
Clear!

602
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,588
Good morning, sweetheart.

603
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,395
Get up now motherfucker, now!

604
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,238
Get up, you sack of shit!

605
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,596
Fuck me!

606
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,396
Dicks!

607
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,270
You'll want to look at this.

608
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,037
Dicks!

609
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,356
Jesus.

610
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,471
Victor?

611
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,031
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

612
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,113
- Call an ambulance.
- Hearse, I'd say.

613
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,628
Call for forensics.

614
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,032
Get your people out.
No on touches anything.

615
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,393
It's like a wax sculpture.

616
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,156
Sloth.

617
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,631
Aw, man.

618
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,871
Goddamn.

619
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,871
The pictures
were dated 3 days ago.

620
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,393
This must be the first.

621
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,077
Look.

622
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,469
It's dated one year ago today.

623
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,992
I got a hair sample.

624
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,117
I got a stool sample, piss,

625
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,396
fingernails.

626
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,228
He's laughing at us.

627
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,352
You got what you deserved.

628
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,870
He's alive!
Cocksucker's alive!

629
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,236
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

630
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,274
- He's playing games.
- No shit.

631
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,756
We have to divorce our emotions.

632
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,911
We must focus on details.

633
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,879
I feed off my emotions,
how's that?

634
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,588
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, I can hear you.

635
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,478
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

636
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,915
- Closed crime scene. Out!
- I got a right to be here.

637
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,513
I'm a UPI photographer.

638
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,238
I got a right to be here.

639
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,198
- Get out! Jesus!
- Fucking jerk!

640
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,919
I got your picture, man.

641
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,508
I got your picture.

642
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,712
Detective Mills, M-i-l-l-s.
Fuck off.

643
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,992
- You can spell.
- Fuck you.

644
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,710
How do they get here so quick?

645
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,556
The pay police for information.
They pay well.

646
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,588
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

647
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,315
They piss me off.

648
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,310
Okay.

649
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,358
It's impressive to see
a man feeding off his emotions.

650
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,798
One year of immobility,
judging by...

651
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,956
muscle and spine deterioration.

652
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,556
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

653
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,836
Even an antibiotic,
probably to prevent

654
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,838
the bedsores from infecting.

655
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,635
Has he tried to speak,
or communicate in any way?

656
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,758
Even if his brain
were not mush, which it is,

657
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,072
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

658
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,232
Doc...

659
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,711
is there no chance
he might survive?

660
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,158
He'd die of shock now
if you shined a flashlight

661
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,992
in his eyes.

662
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,918
He's had as much pain
and suffering as anyone,

663
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,959
and he still has
Hell to look forward to.

664
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,036
Good night.

665
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,474
Hello, William. It's Tracy.

666
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,277
Tracy?

667
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,230
Everything okay?

668
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,830
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

669
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,556
Where's David?

670
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,593
In the other room,
in the shower.

671
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,389
Sorry to call you like this.

672
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,109
It's all right.

673
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,633
What can I do for you?

674
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,997
I need someone to talk to.

675
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,754
Do you think you could
meet me somewhere,

676
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,076
maybe tomorrow morning?

677
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,429
I don't understand.

678
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,559
I feel stupid calling,

679
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,877
but you're the only person
I know here.

680
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,593
There's no on else.

681
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,195
If you can,

682
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,676
give me a call, okay?

683
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,473
I have to go now.

684
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,272
- Good night.
- Good night.

685
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,357
I mean...

686
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,351
you know this city so well.

687
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,110
You've been here...

688
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,510
so long.

689
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,591
It can be a hard place.

690
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,275
I don't know why
I asked you to come.

691
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,791
Why don't you talk to him?

692
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,912
Tell him how you feel.

693
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,760
I can't be a burden.

694
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,274
Especially now.

695
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,198
I'll get used to things,

696
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,317
you know?

697
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,871
I wanted to talk to someone

698
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,509
who's lived here a long time.

699
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,233
Upstate, it's a completely
different environment.

700
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,508
Did David tell you
I teach 5th grade? I did.

701
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,198
He mentioned it.

702
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,239
I've been going around,
looking at schools,

703
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,556
but here the conditions here

704
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,876
are horrible.

705
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,758
What about private schools?

706
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,717
I don't know.

707
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,110
Tell me what's
really bothering you.

708
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,230
David and I
are going to have a baby.

709
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,069
Tracy, I...

710
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,148
I don't think I'm...

711
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,835
the one to talk to...

712
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,834
...about this.
- I hate this city.

713
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,871
I had a relationship once.

714
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,471
It was like a marriage.

715
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,833
We got pregnant.

716
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,071
This was a long time ago.

717
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,797
I remember getting up
and going to work.

718
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,759
A day like any other,
but the first day after I knew

719
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,396
about the pregnancy.

720
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,437
And I felt this fear,

721
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,395
for the first time ever.

722
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,754
I remember thinking:

723
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,557
How can I bring a child
into a world like this?

724
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,678
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

725
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,871
I told her I didn't want it.

726
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,997
Over the next few weeks,

727
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,958
I wore her down.

728
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,317
I want to have children.

729
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,512
I can tell you now that...

730
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,671
I know, I mean,

731
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,108
I'm positive that

732
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,512
I made the right decision.

733
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,238
But not a day passes
that I don't wish

734
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,040
that I'd made
a different choice.

735
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,316
If you don't...

736
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,351
keep the baby...

737
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,158
if that's your decision,

738
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,669
don't ever tell him
you were pregnant.

739
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,118
But if you choose to
have this baby,

740
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,069
then spoil that kid,

741
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,197
every chance you get.

742
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,436
That's about...

743
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,516
all the advice

744
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,916
I can give you, Tracy.

745
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,870
I got to go.

746
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,597
William,

747
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,751
thank you.

748
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,554
Victor's landlord said

749
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,268
there was cash in the mailbox,

750
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,999
first of every month.

751
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,397
Quote:

752
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,714
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

753
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,236
in apartment 306,
and nobody complained about him.

754
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,272
Best tenant I've ever had."

755
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,397
A landlord's dream.

756
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,636
A paralyzed tenant
with no tongue.

757
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,439
Who pays the rent on time.

758
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,038
I'm sick of this waiting.

759
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,229
This is the job.

760
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,192
Why aren't we out there?

761
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,472
Why sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic

762
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,869
does it again?

763
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,033
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

764
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,629
Come on. He's insane.
Look.

765
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,668
Right now he's dancing
in his grandma's panties.

766
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,309
Rubbing himself in peanut butter.

767
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,957
- How's that?
- I don't think so.

768
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,551
His luck will run out.

769
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,352
He's not depending on luck.

770
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,428
We walk in exactly one year
after Victor's tied to the bed.

771
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,999
One year to the day.

772
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,714
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

773
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,796
Oh, yes we do.

774
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,909
The note he left,
his first words to us:

775
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,515
"Long is the way and hard
that out of Hell

776
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,671
leads up to light."

777
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,479
Fuck him. So what?

778
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,034
He's right so far.

779
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,388
Imagine the will to keep
a man bound for a year.

780
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,110
To sever his hand
and to use it...

781
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,839
to plant fingerprints.

782
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,389
To insert tubes into
his genitals.

783
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,469
The guy's methodical, exacting

784
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,597
and worst of all, patient.

785
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,479
He's a nutbag.

786
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,275
Because he's got a library card
doesn't make him Yoda.

787
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,950
You got money?

788
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,159
I got 50 bucks.

789
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,550
I propose a field trip.
Come on.

790
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,954
We'll make a list.
At the top we put "Purgatory",

791
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,869
"Canterbury Tales"
anything on the 7 deadly sins.

792
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,388
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

793
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,273
What would he study
to do things he's done?

794
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,999
What are his interests now?

795
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,756
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

796
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,513
- Where are we going?
- Library.

797
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,640
Coupons!
Free coupons!

798
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,199
Discount coupons!

799
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,556
They must have had
about 50 health violations

800
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,876
during the last inspection.

801
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,714
Sit across from me.
I don't want people thinking

802
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,148
we're dating.

803
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,550
Give me your money.

804
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,189
I'll give you this,
but I must know what we're doing.

805
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,912
Somerset. How you doing?

806
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,754
Didn't expect a ménage á trois.

807
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,877
It's not a problem. Sit down.

808
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,078
Only for you do I do this.
It's a big risk.

809
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,432
- We're just fair and square.
- It's a deal.

810
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,994
About an hour.

811
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,439
Yeah. Help yourself.

812
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,952
That was money well spent.

813
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:11,757
Yeah.

814
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,317
Alright.

815
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,510
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

816
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,830
Good, I'm about ready
to punch you.

817
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,030
It's probably nothing,
but it's no skin off our teeth.

818
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,078
The pizza parlor guy
is a friend from the FBI.

819
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,069
Who, stinky man?

820
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,708
For years, the FBI's been hooked
into the library system.

821
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,269
- Keeping records.
- Assessing fines?

822
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,040
No, monitoring reading habits.

823
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,431
Certain books are flagged.

824
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,870
Books on, say, nuclear weapons,

825
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,679
"Mein Kampf".

826
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,433
Anyone checks out a flagged book,
his library records go to the FBI.

827
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,071
Wait. How is this legal?

828
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,158
Legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

829
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,035
You can't use the information
directly. It's a guide.

830
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,388
Sounds silly, but you can't
get a library card

831
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,319
without an ID card
and current phone bill.

832
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,797
- So they run a list.
- Precisely.

833
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,557
If you want to know who's reading

834
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,036
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter",

835
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,636
the FBI's computers will tell us.
It could give us a name.

836
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,233
Of a college kid
writing a term paper

837
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,793
on 20th century crime.

838
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,397
At least you're out of the office.

839
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,670
Get a haircut.

840
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,196
- How do you know this?
- I don't.

841
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,756
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

842
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,678
"Divine Comedy",

843
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,074
"History of Catholicism",
one called "Murderers and Madmen".

844
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,551
"Modern Homicide Investigation",
"In Cold Blood".

845
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,474
"Of Human Bondage".

846
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,711
- Bondage?
- It's not what you think.

847
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,198
Marquis de Sha-day.

848
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,638
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

849
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,189
Writings of Saint Thomas
Aqua-something.

850
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,192
Saint Thomas Aquinas.
There.

851
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,749
He wrote about
the 7 deadly sins.

852
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,918
- Is that it?
- Yep.

853
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,755
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

854
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,076
Whatever.

855
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,637
We're sure about that name?

856
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,475
You were, you saw it.
John Doe.

857
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,752
You want to go back, I'll go back.

858
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,550
Let's take a look at him,
talk to him.

859
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,508
This is crazy.

860
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,757
We'll just talk to him.

861
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,593
"Excuse me, sir.
Are you a serial killer?"

862
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:51,997
Okay.

863
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,836
You do the talking.

864
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,795
Put that silver tongue
of yours to work.

865
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,598
You been talking to my wife?

866
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,390
Retarded.

867
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,911
Charlie's fucking Angels.

868
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,437
A name off a computer.

869
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:13,717
Mills.

870
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,193
- You hit?
- No.

871
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,708
He's going down.

872
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,150
Fifth floor.

873
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,472
Police.
Is there a back way out?

874
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,955
Lock your door.

875
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,273
Get out of the fucking hall.

876
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,231
Get down.

877
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,750
Get the fuck down!

878
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,951
Goddamn it!

879
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,232
Out of the fucking way! Clear!

880
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:21,751
Mills!

881
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,397
Go.

882
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,591
Where are you going?

883
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,111
- I'm going in.
- No, wait.

884
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,437
- Wait.
- What? He shot at us!

885
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,556
You can't go in.

886
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,951
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

887
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,998
Think how we got here.

888
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,152
- I can't tell about the FBI.
- Get out of the way.

889
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,029
We have no reason to be here.
Listen to me.

890
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,590
- Get the fuck off me.
- Alright. I'm sorry.

891
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,757
Just pay attention a minute.

892
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,596
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

893
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,479
The guy will walk.
That's what you want?

894
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,996
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that!

895
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,198
We need a reason
to knock on this door.

896
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,751
Think about it.

897
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,591
Okay?

898
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,397
Okay.

899
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,910
You're right.
I'm all fucked up.

900
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,275
When you're right, you're right.

901
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,111
Well...

902
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,838
no point in arguing anymore.

903
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,072
Unless you can fix that.

904
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,193
You stupid son of a...

905
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,039
How much money we got left?

906
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,158
So, I noticed this guy
going out a lot,

907
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,228
when the murders was happening,
so I...

908
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,988
- So you called Detective Somerset?
- Right.

909
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,196
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

910
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,079
was creepy and shit
and one of the murders

911
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,158
...happened over there.
- I told you the rest.

912
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,958
- Got everything?
- I got your story.

913
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,997
Have her sign.
You gotta sign.

914
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:45,791
Good.

915
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,116
You did good.

916
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,831
- I did what you said.
- Here.

917
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,798
You get something to eat.

918
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,073
Everybody stay outside.

919
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,151
Victor.

920
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,032
Fuck.

921
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,111
Somerset.

922
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,992
- What?
- We had him.

923
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,871
What are you saying?

924
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,393
Fucking photographer...

925
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,595
on the stairs.

926
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,550
We had him
and we let him go.

927
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,393
You sure this is him?

928
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,513
Yep. Good.
Get it out.

929
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,478
We've got nothing to go on.

930
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,399
No pay stubs, appointment books.
Just this receipt.

931
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,999
- Keep looking.
- Wait, look at this.

932
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,834
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

933
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,315
We got his money.
I like it.

934
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,391
You won't believe this.

935
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,469
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

936
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,274
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

937
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,439
We could us some more men.

938
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,749
I'm doing my best.

939
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,116
- What are you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here.

940
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,874
Each one has about 250 pages.

941
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,758
What about the killings?

942
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,714
"We're sick, ridiculous puppets.
What gross stage we dance on.

943
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,076
What fun, dancing and fucking.

944
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,710
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

945
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,916
We are not what was intended."

946
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,593
Wait, there's a lot more.

947
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,671
"On the subway today,
a man started a conversation.

948
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,948
Small talk, a lonely man talking
about the weather and things.

949
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,952
I tried to be pleasant,

950
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,437
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

951
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,113
I almost didn't notice,

952
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,794
but I suddenly
threw up all over him.

953
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,197
He was not pleased,

954
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,516
and I couldn't stop laughing."

955
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,630
No dates.

956
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,397
Placed on the shelves
in no discernable order.

957
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,112
His mind poured out on paper.

958
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,916
Looks like a life's work.

959
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,311
With 50 men,
reading 24 hour shifts,

960
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,437
...it'd take 2 months.
- I know.

961
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,670
Phone? Phone?

962
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:27,950
People, quiet!

963
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,235
I admire you.

964
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,917
I don't know how you found me.
Imagine my surprise.

965
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:54,230
I respect you officers
more every day.

966
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,436
I appreciate that, John.

967
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,992
- I tell you...
- No, listen.

968
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,074
I'm readjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

969
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,390
I just had to call
to express my admiration.

970
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,039
Sorry I had to hurt...

971
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,511
one of you,
but I had no choice, did I?

972
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,239
Accept my apology?

973
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,677
I'd like to say more,
but that'd ruin the surprise.

974
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,516
Got it.

975
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,475
Everybody back to work.

976
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,029
You were right.

977
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,069
He's preaching.

978
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,596
These murders are
his sermons to us.

979
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
Look, we know him.
We know him.

980
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,113
Who's the blonde?

981
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,799
Looks like a 'pro'.

982
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:53,671
Maybe.

983
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,431
She caught John Doe's eye.

984
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,914
- He collected it last night.
- Last night?

985
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,639
- Yeah.
- This man?

986
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,077
Yeah, John Doe.
Easy name to remember. Had a limp.

987
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,278
- And the job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

988
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,511
One sweet piece, actually.

989
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,115
I thought he was
a performance artist.

990
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,078
The sort of guy that

991
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,919
pisses in a cup on stage

992
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,354
and then drinks it.

993
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,470
Performance art.

994
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,557
Right.

995
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,837
I think I undercharged him.

996
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,116
- You made this for him?
- Yeah, I've made...

997
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,078
weirder shit than that.

998
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,112
They found the blonde.

999
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,996
The picture!

1000
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,919
The picture!

1001
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,474
Fucking pigs!

1002
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,479
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1003
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,591
Get out of the booth!

1004
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,990
I've been in this cage
the whole time.

1005
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,515
Come on, this way.

1006
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,155
- Can you stop this music?
- We're looking for the guy.

1007
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,031
You from Homicide?
You better...

1008
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,235
see this.

1009
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,232
Get this thing off me!

1010
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,517
God, get it off me!

1011
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,913
Get him out of here, now!

1012
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,919
I want to hear it again.

1013
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,588
Tell me again.

1014
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,958
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1015
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,550
- No.
- No?

1016
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,711
He ask me if I was married.

1017
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,430
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1018
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,353
The what?

1019
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,355
The prostitute. Where was she?

1020
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,154
Someone comes to
your establishment...

1021
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,676
they want to go downstairs,
get some ooh-la-la. Whatever.

1022
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,271
They got to come to you.

1023
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:20,632
Yeah.

1024
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,189
You didn't see anyone?

1025
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,231
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1026
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,359
Everybody comes in with
a package under their arm.

1027
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,912
Some guys carry suitcases
full of stuff.

1028
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,117
She was just sitting on the bed.

1029
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,070
Who tied her down? You or him?

1030
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,516
Do you like what you do?

1031
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,199
These things you see?

1032
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,037
No.

1033
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,835
No, I don't.

1034
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,636
But that's life,

1035
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,431
isn't it?

1036
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,479
He had a gun.

1037
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,232
And he made it happen.

1038
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,991
He made me do it.

1039
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,397
He put me that thing on me.

1040
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,710
He made me wear it.

1041
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,791
Then he...

1042
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,437
told me to fuck her.

1043
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,516
And I did. I fucked her.

1044
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,634
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1045
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,110
He had a gun
in my mouth.

1046
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,439
The fucking gun
was in my throat.

1047
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,631
Fuck.

1048
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,838
Oh, God. God.

1049
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,034
God, help me.
Please, help me.

1050
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,113
This won't have a happy ending.

1051
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,754
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy.

1052
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,997
If we catch John Doe
and he's the Devil,

1053
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,872
if he's Satan himself,

1054
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,190
that might meet
our expectations.

1055
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,234
But he's not the Devil.

1056
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,193
He's just a man.

1057
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,671
You know?

1058
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,598
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1059
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,674
If you think you're preparing me
for hard times,

1060
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,030
thanks but...

1061
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,671
But you got to be a hero.

1062
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,359
You want to be a champion.

1063
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,751
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1064
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,514
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1065
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,995
I want to know.

1066
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,108
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1067
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,310
Go on.

1068
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,877
I don't think I can continue
to live in a place...

1069
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,510
that embraces, nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1070
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,592
You aren't different or better.

1071
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,229
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1072
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,432
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1073
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,472
Apathy is a solution.

1074
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,230
It's easier to lose yourself
in drugs...

1075
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,317
than it is to cope with life.

1076
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,269
It's easier to steal what you want
than earn it. It's easier...

1077
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,672
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes work.

1078
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,508
We're talking about
mentally ill people.

1079
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,716
We're talking about crazies.

1080
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,433
- No, we're not.
- Yes. Today.

1081
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,712
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1082
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,389
You can't afford
to be this naive.

1083
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,468
Fuck off.

1084
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,079
You should listen to yourself.

1085
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,913
Yeah. You say that...

1086
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,829
the problem is people don't care.

1087
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,476
So, I don't care
about people.

1088
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,352
Nonsense. You know why?

1089
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:55,796
You care?

1090
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,678
Want to know? Damn right.

1091
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,239
You'll make a difference.

1092
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,675
Whatever. The point is that...

1093
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,508
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1094
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,352
these things you say.

1095
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,068
You want to believe them...

1096
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,958
because you're quitting.

1097
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,200
And you want me
to agree with you and say,

1098
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,351
"You're right, it's a fucking mess.

1099
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,229
We should all go live in
a fucking log cabin."

1100
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,150
But I won't.

1101
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,030
I won't say that.

1102
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,440
I don't agree with you.
I do not.

1103
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,031
I can't.

1104
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,195
I'm going home.

1105
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,719
Thank you, though.

1106
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,790
I love you.

1107
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,275
So much.

1108
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,116
I know.

1109
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,357
911, What's your emergency?

1110
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:39,989
Could you repeat that?

1111
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,639
I've done it again.

1112
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,596
What have we got?

1113
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,474
Sleeping pills.

1114
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,673
Glued to one hand.

1115
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,399
Telephoned glued to the other.

1116
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,229
You see what he did?

1117
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,633
He sliced her up.

1118
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,553
Then he bandaged her.

1119
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,997
"Call for help and you'll live.

1120
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,032
But you'll be disfigured.

1121
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,189
Or put yourself out
of your own misery."

1122
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:17,830
Come on.

1123
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,714
He cut off her nose.

1124
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,439
To spite her face.

1125
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,671
He did it very recently.

1126
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:31,557
Listen,

1127
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,598
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1128
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,071
One of two things will happen.
We'll get John Doe,

1129
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,471
or he'll kill 7
and this case will never end.

1130
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,871
Don't do me any favors.
Thanks, but I got it.

1131
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,680
I'm asking to be
your partner a few days more.

1132
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,558
You'd be doing me a favor.

1133
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,510
You knew I'd say yes.
We're here!

1134
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:07,031
Your wife called.
Get an answer machine.

1135
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,670
Detective?

1136
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,318
After this, I'm gone.

1137
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,356
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1138
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,833
You're looking for me.

1139
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,589
Don't fucking move.

1140
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,836
On the floor!

1141
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,872
- Stay back!
- On the fucking floor!

1142
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,110
I know you.

1143
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,548
Now, get down!

1144
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,633
Get down on your stomach.

1145
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,148
You piece of shit. Now!

1146
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,436
All the way!
All the way, fucker!

1147
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:38,831
Down!

1148
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,030
Faster.

1149
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,556
Faster, fucker. Now.

1150
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,239
Nose on the ground.

1151
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,314
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this?

1152
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,552
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1153
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,269
Godamnit!

1154
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,953
He cuts the skin off
his fingertips. That's why...

1155
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,236
we found no prints
in his apartment.

1156
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,511
He's been doing it for a while.

1157
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,075
The bank accounts? The guns?

1158
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,112
So far it's a dead end.

1159
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,794
No credit history,
no employment records.

1160
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,878
A 5 year old bank account
opened with cash.

1161
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,276
We tried tracing his furniture.

1162
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,919
All we know about him...

1163
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,033
is he's independently wealthy,

1164
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,110
well-educated,

1165
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,072
and totally insane.

1166
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,436
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1167
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,589
- When can we question him?
- You don't. He goes to court now.

1168
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,469
No way he'd turn himself in.
It makes no sense.

1169
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,790
There he sits.

1170
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,156
It's not supposed to
make any sense.

1171
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,469
He's not finished.

1172
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,553
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1173
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,719
You know what I'm saying.

1174
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,870
For the first time,
you and I are in agreement.

1175
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,388
He wouldn't just stop.

1176
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,233
So what the fuck, man?

1177
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,877
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1178
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,912
We'll wait for his plea.

1179
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,354
My client says there are
two more bodies hidden away.

1180
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,951
He will only take
Detectives Mills and Somerset

1181
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,434
to these bodies,

1182
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,557
only at 6 o'clock today.

1183
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,676
Why us?

1184
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,919
He says he admires you.

1185
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,788
Part of the game.

1186
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,079
If they don't accept the offer,
the bodies won't be found.

1187
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,558
Frankly, I'd let them rot.

1188
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,354
We've got him.

1189
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,154
Downstairs, locked up.
He'll get...

1190
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,630
free room and board, cable TV.

1191
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,469
My wife doesn't even have cable!

1192
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:46,878
Something stinks. And this one,
you, in your $3.000 suit,

1193
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:51,079
smug smile on your face,
dealing for that piece of shit.

1194
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,271
Mills!

1195
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,192
The law requires me to serve...

1196
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,551
my clients' interest
as best I can.

1197
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,916
We don't make deals here,
Mr. Swarr.

1198
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,354
My client informs you

1199
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,120
that if you don't accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1200
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,150
Let him try it.

1201
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,029
I'd like to see it.

1202
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:11,909
With the extreme nature
of these crimes, I'd get him off

1203
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,309
with such a plea.

1204
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,835
I won't let this conviction slide.

1205
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,875
If you accept his conditions,
he'll sign a confession,

1206
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,588
plead guilty right now.

1207
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,115
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1208
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,234
Full confession. I'm in.

1209
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,272
Has to be both of you.

1210
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,511
If he claims insanity,

1211
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,593
this conversation is inadmissible.

1212
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,871
Blackmailing with his plea.

1213
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,634
My client wants to remind you,
two more are dead.

1214
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,116
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned

1215
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,476
about finding and burying them.

1216
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,637
If there are two more dead.

1217
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,194
The lab report came.

1218
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,954
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothes and fingernails.

1219
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,317
They found blood
from Doe's fingers,

1220
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,797
blood from the woman
whose face he cut off,

1221
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,519
and a third party,

1222
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,352
as yet unidentified.

1223
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,831
You'd be escorting
an unarmed man.

1224
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,199
Let's finish it.

1225
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,513
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out,

1226
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,711
I want you to expect it.

1227
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,631
I will.

1228
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,194
If I accidentally
shave off a nipple,

1229
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,510
would it be covered by
worker's comp?

1230
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:39,949
I suppose so.

1231
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,194
If you were man enough
to file a claim,

1232
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,073
I'd buy you one myself.

1233
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,117
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1234
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,437
You know...?

1235
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:02,832
Yeah.

1236
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:09,791
What?

1237
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,437
Will this wind hurt us?

1238
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,475
Who are you, John?

1239
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,748
Who are you really?

1240
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,674
What do you mean?

1241
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,356
At this stage, there's no harm
telling us about yourself?

1242
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:19,031
Doesn't matter who I am.
It means absolutely nothing.

1243
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,878
Stay on your left up here.

1244
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,914
Where are we heading?

1245
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,110
You'll see.

1246
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,151
We're not just picking up
two more bodies, are we?

1247
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,591
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1248
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,513
You've got the papers
to think about, yeah?

1249
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,791
Wanting people to listen,

1250
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,075
you can't just...

1251
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,510
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1252
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,796
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1253
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:50,032
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1254
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,599
But the question is:

1255
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,640
Why are you so special
that people should listen?

1256
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,189
I'm not special.

1257
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,111
I've never been exceptional.

1258
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,434
This is, though.
What I'm doing.

1259
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,510
My work.

1260
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,188
Your work, John?

1261
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,271
Yes.

1262
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,758
I don't see anything
special about it, John.

1263
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,189
That's not true.

1264
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:16,194
No, it is. Funny thing is,
after all this work,

1265
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,479
in 2 months no one'll care,
give a shit, or remember.

1266
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,878
You can't see
the complete act yet.

1267
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,392
But when this is done,

1268
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,914
when it's finished,

1269
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,834
it's going to be...

1270
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,833
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1271
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,311
But they won't be able to deny.

1272
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,358
Could the freak be more vague?

1273
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,839
As far as master plans go...

1274
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,636
I can't wait for you to see.

1275
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,478
It's going to be something.

1276
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,948
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1277
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,277
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1278
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,669
I don't want to miss it.

1279
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,992
Don't worry. You won't.

1280
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,990
You won't miss a thing.

1281
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,833
What's so exciting?

1282
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,399
It's not too far now.

1283
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,236
I tried to figure out something.
Maybe you can help me?

1284
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,788
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are,

1285
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,553
do you know you're insane?

1286
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,993
Maybe you're reading,

1287
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,071
masturbating in your own feces,

1288
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,992
do you just stop and go:

1289
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,551
"Wow, it's amazing how
fucking crazy I really am"?

1290
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,235
Yeah? You guys do that?

1291
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,553
It's more comfortable for you
to label me insane.

1292
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,915
It's very comfortable.

1293
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,558
It's not something
I'd expect you to accept.

1294
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,839
But I did not choose.
I was chosen.

1295
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,155
Whatever.

1296
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,749
I don't doubt
that you believe that.

1297
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,799
But it seems that you're...

1298
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,395
overlooking a contradiction.

1299
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,396
Meaning what?

1300
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,113
Glad you asked.

1301
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,398
If you were chosen,

1302
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,676
by a higher power,

1303
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:37,636
if your hand was forced,

1304
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,678
it seems strange

1305
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,232
you'd get
such enjoyment.

1306
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,190
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1307
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,272
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1308
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,397
John?

1309
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:02,833
I doubt I enjoyed it any more than
Mills would enjoy time with me

1310
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,071
in a room without windows.

1311
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,556
Isn't that true?

1312
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,759
How'd you like to...

1313
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,719
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1314
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,548
I would never.

1315
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,268
Only because
there's consequences.

1316
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,750
It's in your eyes, though.

1317
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,914
Nothing wrong with a man
talking pleasure in his work.

1318
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,159
I won't deny
my own personal desire...

1319
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,311
to turn each sin
against the sinner.

1320
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,476
Wait, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1321
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,834
Innocent?
Is that supposed to be funny?

1322
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,670
An obese man.

1323
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,749
A disgusting man
who could barely stand,

1324
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,959
who you'd point out so your
friends would join you mocking him.

1325
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:50,113
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1326
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:54,590
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1327
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,679
A man dedicated to making money

1328
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,834
by lying with every breath
he could muster to keep

1329
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,355
murderers and rapists...

1330
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,198
...on the streets.
- Murderers?

1331
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:07,790
Murderers, like yourself.

1332
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,794
A woman so ugly inside,
she couldn't go on living

1333
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,076
if she wasn't beautiful outside?

1334
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:18,114
A drug dealer.
A pederast, actually.

1335
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,272
Let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1336
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,636
Only in a world this shitty...

1337
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,476
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1338
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,953
But that's the point.

1339
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:38,432
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner,

1340
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,113
in every home,

1341
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,310
and we tolerate it.

1342
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,195
We tolerate it because
it's common.

1343
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,636
It's trivial.

1344
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,119
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1345
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,753
Well, not anymore.

1346
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,918
I'm setting the example.

1347
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,113
And what I've done

1348
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,589
will be puzzled over

1349
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,235
and studied

1350
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,914
and followed...

1351
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:09,790
forever.

1352
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,357
Yeah.

1353
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,154
Delusions of grandeur.

1354
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,872
You should be thanking me.

1355
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,589
Why's that, John?

1356
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,593
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1357
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:26,430
Realize, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1358
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,717
is that I wanted to be.

1359
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,190
No, we would have got you.

1360
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,390
Really?

1361
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,879
Were you biding your time?
Toying with me?

1362
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,198
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die...

1363
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,635
until you sprang your trap?

1364
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,592
What was the evidence...

1365
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,474
you were going to use on me...

1366
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:51,110
right before I walked up
and put my hands in the air?

1367
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,992
John. Calm down.

1368
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,794
I remember us knocking
on your door.

1369
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,756
That's right.

1370
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,158
And I remember
breaking your face.

1371
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,990
You're alive because
I didn't kill you.

1372
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,674
Okay, sit back.

1373
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,591
I spared you.

1374
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,716
Sit back.

1375
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,195
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1376
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,317
for the rest of your life.

1377
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,751
Or I should say
the rest of the life...

1378
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,075
I allow you to have.

1379
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,038
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1380
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:24,719
Shut your fucking mouth.

1381
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,472
You're no messiah.
You're a T-shirt,

1382
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,869
at best.

1383
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,309
Don't ask me
to pity those people.

1384
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:51,235
I mourn them as much as the
thousands at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1385
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,593
You're saying you were doing
God's good work?

1386
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,833
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

1387
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,110
See those high-tension towers?

1388
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,913
That's where we're headed.

1389
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,879
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1390
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,879
There sure as shit
ain't no ambush out here.

1391
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,315
No fucking nothing out here.

1392
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,718
They'll come behind us
in about two minutes.

1393
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,917
I want you to go way up.

1394
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:38,197
In 30 seconds,
bank east on my mark.

1395
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,596
I'll get him out.

1396
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,917
Get out.

1397
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:47,950
Slowly.

1398
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,517
Stop.

1399
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,791
Stay.

1400
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,275
What do you got?

1401
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,796
A dead dog.

1402
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,989
I didn't do that.

1403
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,995
What time is it?

1404
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,596
Why?

1405
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,229
I'd like to know.

1406
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,595
7:01.

1407
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,630
It's close.

1408
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,994
Let's go take a look.

1409
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:28,436
It's this way.

1410
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,997
Down. Down. Down.

1411
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,756
Watch him.

1412
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,470
There he goes.

1413
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,710
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1414
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:34,359
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1415
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,154
A van's coming down the road.

1416
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,311
From the north.

1417
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:57,508
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal.

1418
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:03,831
Get out!

1419
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,316
Out!

1420
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,517
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1421
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,510
Step away.

1422
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,517
Turn around.
Hands on your head.

1423
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,036
What's going on?

1424
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,235
Why are you here?

1425
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,796
I'm delivering a package
to this guy, David.

1426
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,190
Detective...

1427
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,589
David Mills.

1428
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,312
Get it. Slowly.

1429
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,955
A guy paid me $500 to bring it.

1430
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,390
He wanted it here
at exactly 7 o'clock.

1431
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,155
Put it down.

1432
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,395
We got a box.

1433
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,989
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1434
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,639
Bomb squad, we got a box.

1435
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,393
Face the van.

1436
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:00,870
Hands up.

1437
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,396
Turn around.

1438
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,155
Okay, go.

1439
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,879
Off you go. Go.

1440
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,751
I sent the driver out on foot.

1441
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,595
He's headed north.

1442
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,556
Have him picked up.

1443
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,156
I don't know.

1444
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:41,990
I'm going to open it.

1445
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:45,757
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1446
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,156
It's blood.

1447
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,675
You've made yourself quite a life.

1448
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:11,470
- You should be very proud.
- Shut up, you piece of shit.

1449
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,314
California, stay away.

1450
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,437
Stay away. Don't come in here.

1451
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,997
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1452
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,912
John Doe has the upper hand.

1453
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:47,831
Mills!

1454
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,476
Here he comes.

1455
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,518
- Throw your gun down.
- What?

1456
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,876
- I wish I could've lived like you.
- Shut up.

1457
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,030
What are you saying?

1458
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,034
Do you hear me, Detective?

1459
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,839
I'm trying to tell you...

1460
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,389
how I admire you
and your pretty wife.

1461
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,031
What?

1462
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,391
Tracy.

1463
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,909
- What did you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1464
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,833
how easily a member
of the press can get...

1465
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,638
information from your precinct.

1466
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,029
What the fuck?

1467
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,193
Throw your gun down!

1468
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,877
I visited your home this morning,

1469
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,159
after you left.

1470
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,752
I tried to play husband.

1471
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,551
I tried to taste
the life of a simple man.

1472
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,670
Throw it away!

1473
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,633
It didn't work out.

1474
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,110
So...

1475
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,872
I took a souvenir.

1476
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,158
Her pretty head.

1477
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,195
- What's he talking about?
- Give me your gun.

1478
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,509
What's going on?

1479
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,556
Put the gun down.

1480
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,949
What was in the box?

1481
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:52,753
I envy your normal life.

1482
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:53,910
Drop the gun.

1483
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,758
It seems envy is my sin.

1484
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,672
- What's in the box?
- Give me the gun.

1485
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,273
What's in the fucking box?

1486
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,108
He just told you.

1487
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,318
You lie! You're a
fucking liar! Shut up!

1488
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,554
That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.

1489
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,834
Say it's not true.

1490
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,031
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance.

1491
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,355
She's all right.

1492
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:17,396
Become...

1493
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:18,597
wrath.

1494
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,955
She's okay.

1495
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,034
If you murder a suspect,

1496
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,675
you throw it all away.
He knows that.

1497
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,791
- She begged for her life.
- Shut up.

1498
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:29,877
She begged for her life,

1499
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:32,151
and for the baby inside her.

1500
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,115
He didn't know.

1501
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,238
Give me the gun, David.

1502
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:14,790
If you kill him,

1503
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:17,755
he will win.

1504
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,109
Oh, God!

1505
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,750
Oh, God!

1506
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,319
We'll take care of him.

1507
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,713
Whatever he needs.

1508
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,428
Where are you going to be?

1509
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,070
Around.

1510
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,749
I'll be around.

1511
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,072
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1512
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:06,513
"The world is a fine place,
and worth fighting for".

1513
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,830
I agree about the second part.
