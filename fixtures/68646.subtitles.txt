1
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:49,662
I believe in America.

2
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:52,707
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,920
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:01,841
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,429
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:10,934
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:12,727
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:18,525
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,195
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:26,658
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:30,870
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:35,208
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:42,006
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,553
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:52,183
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:57,730
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,735
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,406
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:13,037
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,962
Sorry.

21
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:33,933
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,686
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,565
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,775
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:48,948
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:54,537
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:58,124
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:04,964
Then I said to my wife, " For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone. "

29
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:14,766
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:20,980
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:22,732
What is that?

32
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,703
I want them dead.

33
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,133
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,971
I 'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,895
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:07,110
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:12,031
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:17,120
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:20,957
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,459
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:26,212
I understand.

42
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,591
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:37,557
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,351
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:45,565
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:48,067
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

47
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:52,822
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:57,618
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:06,210
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:08,838
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,924
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:16,429
Let them suffer , then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,850
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:39,452
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,623
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,293
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:51,798
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:58,096
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,851
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:09,482
Be my friend?

61
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,987
Godfather?

62
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,535
Good.

63
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:27,834
Some day, and that day may never
come, I 'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,337
But until that day

65
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:37,427
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,929
<i> -Gràzie, Godfather.
-Prego.</i>

67
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:49,689
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:55,445
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,699
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:28,394
-Where's Michael?
-Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,607
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,407
-What's the matter?
-It's Michael.

73
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,750
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:52,436
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,772
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:01,821
-You look terrific on the floor.
-Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,156
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:15,167
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:17,712
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:43,112
20 , 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,449
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:50,119
<i>If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!</i>

83
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,454
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:55,333
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,500
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,553
What's the matter?

87
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:22,401
-Have to go back to work.
-Tom.

88
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:26,739
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:37,583
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,633
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,679
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,979
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:05,361
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:24,171
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,341
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,177
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,221
Now that the war is over ,

98
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:36,308
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:41,272
Godfather , I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:46,986
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,448
You understand everything.

102
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:53,659
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:11:56,787 --> 00:12:00,750
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,586
The bride, the groom and the angel...

105
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:13,387
-Who should I give this job to?
-Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:18,601
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,234
Hey, Michael!

108
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,508
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,724
Is this necessary?

110
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:03,437
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:10,194
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:13,113
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:15,616
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:18,244
Michael...

115
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:23,415
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,335
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,922
-He's a very scary guy.
-What's his name?

118
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:34,677
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,390
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,563
You look terrific!

121
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:48,941
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:52,945
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:55,865
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

124
00:13:57,616 --> 00:14:00,327
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:04,290
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:08,294
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,132
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,175
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,598
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be consigliere.

130
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:23,601
-What's that?
-That's a,

131
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:27,479
like a counselor , an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,649
You like your lasagna?

133
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,114
Don Corleone.

134
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:39,867
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,787
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,087
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:57,009
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:03,557
I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.

139
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:10,940
-For your daughter's bridal purse.
-Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:16,153
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,030
Thank you.

142
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:09,873
Signora Corleone!

143
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,919
No!

144
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,118
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:32,456
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,710
What is that outside?

147
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:50,349
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,060
I love you!

149
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,782
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:10,369
-He's probably in trouble again.
-He's a good godson.

151
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,707
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:34,143
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:38,313
-Sure. You want to meet him?
-Great! Sure.

154
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:42,234
-My father helped him with his career.
-He did?

155
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:43,402
How?

156
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,782
-Let's listen to this song.
-Michael...

157
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:24,276
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:32,826
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,787
with a big bandleader.

160
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:40,125
And as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,879
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,299
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:51,261
He offered him $ 10 ,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:54,097
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:59,561
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:03,565
Within an hour ,

167
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:09,154
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.

168
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:15,118
-How did he do that?
-Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:21,667
-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:27,005
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,637
That's a true story.

172
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,734
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,999
Beautiful!

174
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,366
I'll take care of it.

175
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,327
Tom...

176
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,122
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:52,341
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:55,010
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,388
-Hi.
-How are you doing?

180
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:04,853
-This is my brother Mike.
-Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:07,522
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:12,277
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:20,452
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:25,874
But this...man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:29,211
-What's his name?
-Woltz.

186
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:33,465
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,012
Sonny?

188
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,807
Sonny?

189
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,481
Sonny?

190
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:53,068
-Sonny, are you in there?
-What?

191
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:55,028
The old man wants you.

192
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,989
One minute.

193
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:17,467
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best -seller.

194
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:21,138
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,890
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,686
Godfather , I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:33,275
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:39,072
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

199
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:43,201
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

200
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:44,995
Ridiculous.

201
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,836
-You spend time with your family?
-Sure I do.

202
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,546
Good.

203
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:59,301
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:08,393
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:13,773
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:16,985
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:20,238
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:28,079
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:33,293
-I want you to leave it all to me.
-All right.

210
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,657
-What time does my daughter leave?
-Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,369
Do we give your son -in -law
something important?

212
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:12,791
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:15,669
-What else?
-Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:20,215
-We'll have to see him next week.
-When you come back from California.

215
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,719
-When am I going to California?
-Tonight.

216
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:30,141
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:35,605
If there's nothing else, I 'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:40,735
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:43,572
Wait a minute.

220
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,949
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,331
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:46,653
-You need a little more heat on that arc.
-Start talking.

223
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:50,156
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

224
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,993
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

225
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,913
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

226
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:59,332
Woltz is listening.

227
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:03,503
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

228
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:14,222
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

229
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:17,851
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

230
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:22,021
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

231
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:26,401
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!

232
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,070
Let me lay it on the line.

233
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:31,156
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

234
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:35,785
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

235
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:39,706
-I'm German -Irish.
-Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.

236
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,169
-I'm going to make trouble for you!
-I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

237
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:47,630
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

238
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:51,259
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

239
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,344
I'll wait for your call.

240
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:58,057
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

241
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,355
Check him out.

242
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,422
-It's really beautiful.
-Look at this.

243
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:34,010
-It used to decorate a king's palace.
-Very nice.

244
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,471
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

245
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:40,809
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

246
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,229
-I only use his name when necessary.
-How's your drink?

247
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:47,816
-Fine.
-Now I'll show you something beautiful.

248
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:50,485
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

249
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:56,491
There you are. $600 ,000 on four hoofs.

250
00:29:56,574 --> 00:30:00,537
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

251
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,163
Khartoum.

252
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,082
Khartoum.

253
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:10,004
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

254
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:13,132
Thanks, Tony.

255
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:16,845
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:20,348
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

257
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:24,853
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

258
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:28,857
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

259
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,276
This favor I can't give him.

260
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,654
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

261
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:40,910
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

262
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:44,664
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

263
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:48,877
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

264
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:55,550
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

265
00:30:55,633 --> 00:31:01,014
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

266
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:05,727
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

267
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,605
Let me be even more frank.

268
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:13,693
To show you that I'm not a hard -hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

269
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,405
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

270
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:22,911
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

271
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:29,125
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

272
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,919
And she runs off.

273
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:36,341
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

274
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:41,596
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

275
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,015
You get the hell out of here!

276
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:48,478
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

277
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:52,774
Yeah, I heard that story.

278
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:57,612
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

279
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,573
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

280
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:04,243
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

281
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:00,860
-You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
-No, I slept on the plane.

282
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:04,030
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

283
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,364
Now...

284
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,912
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

285
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,955
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

286
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,460
<i>but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.</i>

287
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:20,797
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

288
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,258
<i>He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

289
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:28,179
<i>In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

290
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:31,766
<i>He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.</i>

291
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,770
<i>He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.</i>

292
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:41,109
<i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.</i>

293
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:46,989
-What about his prison record?
-One term in Italy, one here.

294
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:49,826
He's known as a top narcotics man.

295
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:54,580
-Santino, what do you think?
-A lot of money in that white powder.

296
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,292
Tom?

297
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:02,547
<i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.</i>

298
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,385
<i>If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.</i>

299
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:11,931
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

300
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:14,100
Then they come after us.

301
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:20,731
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great¤, but narcotics is the future.

302
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:25,945
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

303
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:33,578
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

304
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,084
Don Corleone.

305
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,464
I need a man who has powerful friends.

306
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,301
I need a million dollars in cash.

307
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:54,223
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

308
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:59,687
-What is the interest for my family?
-30%.

309
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,733
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

310
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:05,818
And then it would go up.

311
00:36:07,028 --> 00:36:10,448
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

312
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,285
My compliments.

313
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:21,375
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

314
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:25,755
So I receive 30% for finance,

315
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,175
political influence and legal protection?

316
00:36:29,258 --> 00:36:30,968
That's right.

317
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:36,182
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

318
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:41,562
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

319
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,814
te salud, Don Corleone.

320
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:59,580
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

321
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:01,916
to be treated with respect.

322
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:09,882
But, I must say no to you.

323
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,886
And I'll give you my reason.

324
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,806
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

325
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:22,478
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

326
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:28,192
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

327
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:33,281
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

328
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:38,619
But your business is...a little dangerous.

329
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:43,124
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

330
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:46,711
-The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
-Wait a minute.

331
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,806
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

332
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:02,143
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

333
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:07,648
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

334
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:11,193
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

335
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:16,115
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

336
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,679
Santino.

337
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,598
Come here.

338
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,852
What's the matter with you?

339
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:49,565
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

340
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:53,778
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

341
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:56,322
Go on.

342
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,120
Tom, what's this nonsense?

343
00:39:03,204 --> 00:39:06,624
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

344
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,545
-Take it away.
-Take it over there.

345
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,382
And

346
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:17,593
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

347
00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:27,144
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

348
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:30,189
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

349
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,819
Go to the Tattaglias.

350
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:39,198
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

351
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,952
and find out what you can.

352
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:03,722
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

353
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:08,477
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

354
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,814
-What do you want for Christmas?
-Just you.

355
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,639
<i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>

356
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:49,143
-Tell Paulie to get the car.
-Okay, Pop.

357
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:53,230
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

358
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:58,235
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

359
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:03,824
<i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>

360
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:50,746
-Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
-I know.

361
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:01,674
You know who I am?

362
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:03,092
I know you.

363
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:07,972
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

364
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:12,977
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:17,481
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:20,943
I heard you are not happy...

367
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,654
...with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:26,156
Want to join me?

369
00:42:27,324 --> 00:42:29,285
What's in it for me?

370
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:34,832
$50 ,000 to start with.

371
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,085
Not bad!

372
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,380
Agreed?

373
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:44,526
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

374
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:49,573
-Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
-I haven't got time.

375
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:52,701
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

376
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:59,041
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

377
00:43:59,124 --> 00:44:00,584
Get in.

378
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,307
-Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
-Okay, Pop.

379
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:24,942
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

380
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:56,533
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

381
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,662
No.

382
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:05,125
-What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
-Now, that's a thought.

383
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,671
Michael.

384
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:12,174
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

385
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:14,051
What's the matter?

386
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:33,612
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

387
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:59,179
<i>-Sonny, it's Michael.
-Where have you been?</i>

388
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:02,015
<i>-Is he all right?
-We don't know yet.</i>

389
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:06,144
<i>There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

390
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,358
<i> -Are you there?
-Yeah, I'm here.</i>

391
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:16,363
<i> -Where have you been? I was worried.
-Didn't Tom tell you I called?</i>

392
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:20,492
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

393
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,543
Oh, my God.

394
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:34,965
Sonny!

395
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:46,143
Stay back there.

396
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:48,896
-Who is it?
-Open up, it's Clemenza.

397
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:54,568
There's more news about your old man.

398
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:56,820
Word is out that he's already dead.

399
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:01,158
-What's the matter with you?
-Take it easy!

400
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,578
-Where was Paulie?
-Sick. He's been sick all winter.

401
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:07,080
-How often?
-Only three, four times.

402
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,959
-Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
-Pick him up now.

403
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:15,881
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

404
00:48:15,964 --> 00:48:19,051
-You want anyone sent over here?
-No. Go ahead.

405
00:48:28,226 --> 00:48:32,230
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

406
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,319
<i>-Hello?
-Santino Corleone?</i>

407
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:40,238
<i>-Yeah.
-We have Tom Hagen.</i>

408
00:48:40,322 --> 00:48:44,034
<i>In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.</i>

409
00:48:44,117 --> 00:48:47,454
<i>Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.</i>

410
00:48:47,537 --> 00:48:52,167
<i>What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>

411
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,961
I'll wait.

412
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:10,310
Your boss is dead.

413
00:49:13,146 --> 00:49:17,567
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

414
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:22,531
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

415
00:49:26,493 --> 00:49:30,998
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

416
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:33,709
Drink it.

417
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:41,925
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

418
00:49:46,138 --> 00:49:48,932
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

419
00:49:50,308 --> 00:49:53,145
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

420
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:59,443
-Sonny will come after you.
-That will be his first reaction, sure.

421
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:07,367
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

422
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:12,539
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

423
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:17,836
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don  - rest in peace  - was slipping.

424
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:23,842
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

425
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:31,683
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

426
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:39,357
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

427
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:46,406
It's good business, Tom.

428
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:52,621
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

429
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,459
Yeah, well...

430
00:50:59,294 --> 00:51:01,671
Let me worry about Luca.

431
00:51:06,885 --> 00:51:09,262
You just talk to Sonny.

432
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,598
And the other two kids.

433
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,062
-I'll do my best.
-Good.

434
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:21,858
Now you can go.

435
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:33,370
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

436
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:35,914
Blood is a big expense.

437
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:59,020
He's still alive.

438
00:51:59,104 --> 00:52:03,066
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

439
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,904
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

440
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:57,454
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

441
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:05,921
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

442
00:53:06,004 --> 00:53:09,424
-You gonna kill all those guys?
-Stay out of it.

443
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:11,968
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

444
00:53:12,052 --> 00:53:16,348
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

445
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:20,227
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

446
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,897
-Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
-We've been trying all night.

447
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,026
-Hey, do me a favor...
-Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

448
00:53:30,111 --> 00:53:35,325
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

449
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:42,666
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

450
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:48,421
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

451
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:53,051
This is almost 1 946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

452
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:54,803
If your father dies

453
00:53:57,222 --> 00:53:58,974
you make the deal.

454
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:03,937
-Easy to say. He's not your father.
-I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

455
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:10,026
What is it?

456
00:54:11,027 --> 00:54:16,825
-Paulie, I told you to stay put.
-The guy at the gates has a package.

457
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:19,035
Tessio, go see what it is.

458
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:24,624
-Shall I stay?
-Yeah. Are you all right?

459
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,461
-I'm fine.
-There's food. Are you hungry?

460
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:32,132
-No.
-A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

461
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:34,843
-Go ahead.
-That might be a good idea.

462
00:54:36,594 --> 00:54:42,642
Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

463
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:46,313
-Make that the first thing on your list.
-Understood.

464
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:50,692
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

465
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:54,487
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

466
00:54:57,032 --> 00:55:00,744
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

467
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,538
Try Luca again.

468
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:15,216
-What's this?
-A Sicilian message.

469
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,178
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

470
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,985
-I'm going.
-When will you be home?

471
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,737
Probably late.

472
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:41,951
-Don't forget the cannoli!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:55:44,204 --> 00:55:48,708
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear -view mirror.

474
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:53,671
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

475
00:55:53,755 --> 00:55:59,636
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

476
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:03,223
-Know a good spot on the West Side?
-I'll think about it.

477
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:07,060
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

478
00:56:07,143 --> 00:56:08,895
Watch the kids.

479
00:56:19,781 --> 00:56:25,578
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

480
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:27,080
Yeah, all right.

481
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:31,584
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

482
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:35,922
-They're clean and exterminated.
-That's a bad word to use.

483
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:39,968
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

484
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:49,185
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

485
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,272
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

486
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:55,335
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

487
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:59,380
-Yeah.
-Phone call!

488
00:58:05,428 --> 00:58:07,639
-Who is it?
-Some girl.

489
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:14,354
<i>-Hello. Kay?
-How's your father?</i>

490
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:16,439
He's going to make it.

491
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:18,733
<i>I love you.</i>

492
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:21,778
i>I love you!

493
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:25,240
<i> -Michael?
-Yeah, I know.</i>

494
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:28,243
<i> -Tell me you love me.
-I can't talk.</i>

495
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:30,203
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

496
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:33,289
I'll see you tonight.

497
00:58:34,082 --> 00:58:37,210
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

498
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:42,090
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

499
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:48,054
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

500
00:58:48,137 --> 00:58:51,766
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

501
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:57,522
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

502
00:58:57,605 --> 00:59:01,693
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

503
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,655
Add a little bit of wine.

504
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:13,329
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

505
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:17,709
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

506
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:20,003
You won't see him no more.

507
00:59:21,462 --> 00:59:23,965
-Where are you going?
-To the city.

508
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:27,552
-Send bodyguards with him.
-I'm going to the hospital...

509
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:30,972
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

510
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:33,057
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

511
00:59:36,185 --> 00:59:38,479
Send somebody with him anyway.

512
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:09,594
-I have to go.
-Can I go with you?

513
01:00:11,387 --> 01:00:15,725
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

514
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,935
I'll wait in the cab.

515
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:23,191
I don't want you to get involved.

516
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,154
When will I see you again?

517
01:00:34,494 --> 01:00:38,623
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

518
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:45,088
-When will I see you again, Michael?
-I don't know.

519
01:02:57,303 --> 01:03:01,140
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

520
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:04,727
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

521
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:07,146
What happened to the guards?

522
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:12,652
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

523
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:16,072
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

524
01:03:20,576 --> 01:03:24,539
Get me Long Beach 45620 , please.

525
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,418
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

526
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:38,302
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

527
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:42,682
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

528
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:45,268
<i> -Don't panic.
-I won't panic.</i>

529
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:49,605
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

530
01:03:52,316 --> 01:03:55,152
We're going to move him
to another room.

531
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:58,239
Can you disconnect the tubes?

532
01:03:58,322 --> 01:04:01,868
-That's out of the question!
-Do you know my father?

533
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:06,247
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

534
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,124
Help me, please.

535
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:28,996
-Who are you?
-I am Enzo, the baker.

536
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:32,083
-Remember me?
-Enzo.

537
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,294
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

538
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:40,007
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

539
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:46,138
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

540
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,307
I'll be out in a minute.

541
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:05,825
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

542
01:06:07,785 --> 01:06:09,829
I'm with you now.

543
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:12,999
I'm with you.

544
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,619
Get rid of these. Come here.

545
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:56,000
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

546
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:49,011
You did good.

547
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,771
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

548
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:45,484
-Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
-You little punk!

549
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:49,488
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

550
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:55,536
-Stay away from this hospital!
-Not until my father's room is guarded.

551
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:59,665
-Phil, take him in!
-The kid's clean, Captain.

552
01:08:59,748 --> 01:09:03,586
-He's a war hero. He's never been...
-I said take him in!

553
01:09:05,754 --> 01:09:12,011
-What's The Turk paying you?
-Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

554
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,971
Stand him up straight.

555
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:41,749
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

556
01:09:41,832 --> 01:09:44,251
They're licensed to carry firearms.

557
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:48,756
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

558
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,841
Let him go.

559
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:27,169
-What's with all the new faces?
-We'll need them now.

560
01:10:27,253 --> 01:10:30,130
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

561
01:10:30,214 --> 01:10:33,384
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

562
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,512
Jesus Christ.

563
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:45,688
Looks like a fortress around here.

564
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:53,195
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

565
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,865
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

566
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:00,995
Mike, let me look at you.

567
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,085
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

568
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:13,799
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.

569
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:16,635
-He wants a meeting today.
-What did he say?

570
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:21,557
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

571
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,102
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

572
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:28,272
-And Bruno Tattaglia?
-That's part of the deal.

573
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:32,651
-He cancels out what they did to Father.
-We should listen to them.

574
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:35,863
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

575
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:39,491
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

576
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:42,619
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

577
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:45,664
-The other families...
-They hand me Sollozzo!

578
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:48,042
This is business, not personal!

579
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:52,546
-They shot my father...
-Even that was business, not personal.

580
01:11:53,464 --> 01:11:57,217
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

581
01:11:57,301 --> 01:12:01,305
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

582
01:12:07,603 --> 01:12:11,523
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

583
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:15,903
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

584
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:20,032
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

585
01:12:20,115 --> 01:12:23,869
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

586
01:12:23,952 --> 01:12:27,539
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

587
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:33,587
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

588
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:37,508
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

589
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:42,638
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

590
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,477
All right, we'll wait.

591
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:56,735
We can't wait. We can't wait.

592
01:12:58,195 --> 01:13:02,157
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

593
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:05,953
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

594
01:13:06,036 --> 01:13:10,332
-Mike is right.
-Let me ask you something.

595
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:15,003
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

596
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:23,053
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

597
01:13:23,929 --> 01:13:28,350
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

598
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,354
Let's set the meeting.

599
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:38,235
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

600
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,866
We insist it's a public place.
A bar , a restaurant.

601
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:47,703
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

602
01:13:50,456 --> 01:13:53,459
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

603
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,878
So I can't have a weapon on me.

604
01:13:59,256 --> 01:14:04,219
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

605
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:11,393
then I'll kill them both.

606
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:28,202
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

607
01:14:28,327 --> 01:14:31,955
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

608
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:38,587
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

609
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,715
You're taking this very personal.

610
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:45,219
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

611
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:48,805
-Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
-Mikey...

612
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:55,020
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

613
01:14:56,063 --> 01:15:00,359
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

614
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:05,030
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

615
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:10,327
-They might like a story like that.
-They might.

616
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:17,584
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

617
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,339
It's as cold as they come.

618
01:15:22,422 --> 01:15:25,676
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

619
01:15:26,093 --> 01:15:30,138
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

620
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:44,403
Is the trigger too tight?

621
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:48,949
My ears!

622
01:15:49,032 --> 01:15:53,662
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.

623
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:57,749
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

624
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,797
-Sit down, finish my dinner.
-Don't fool around.

625
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,426
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

626
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:11,930
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

627
01:16:12,014 --> 01:16:14,891
so walk out fast, but don't run.

628
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,395
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

629
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:21,982
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

630
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:28,280
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

631
01:16:28,363 --> 01:16:30,449
and we'll catch the hell.

632
01:16:31,074 --> 01:16:34,911
-How bad do you think it will be?
-Pretty goddamn bad.

633
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:38,040
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

634
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:43,712
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

635
01:16:43,837 --> 01:16:48,258
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

636
01:16:48,383 --> 01:16:54,097
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

637
01:16:55,515 --> 01:17:00,020
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

638
01:17:00,103 --> 01:17:01,813
Your father too.

639
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:43,313
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

640
01:17:44,272 --> 01:17:48,527
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

641
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,946
How much time do we have?

642
01:17:51,822 --> 01:17:56,618
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

643
01:17:57,619 --> 01:18:02,499
-We could put a tail on them.
-Sollozzo would lose our ass.

644
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:08,422
-What about the negotiator?
-He's playing pinochle with my men.

645
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:13,635
-He's happy. They're letting him win.
-Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

646
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:17,097
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

647
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:21,226
-He could blast whoever is in the car.
-They'll expect that.

648
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:24,646
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car , Sonny!

649
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,231
I'll get it.

650
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:53,675
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

651
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:57,095
-Is it reliable?
-My man in McCluskey's precinct.

652
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,934
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

653
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:07,898
-Anybody know this joint?
-Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

654
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:12,944
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

655
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:18,867
They've got an old -fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

656
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:23,955
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

657
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:28,168
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

658
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:32,130
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

659
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:37,552
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

660
01:19:37,636 --> 01:19:42,098
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

661
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,353
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

662
01:19:46,436 --> 01:19:49,940
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

663
01:19:50,023 --> 01:19:55,570
-The gun will be there.
-You drive him and pick him up.

664
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:57,322
Let's move.

665
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:05,997
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

666
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:07,958
Yeah, a million times.

667
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:16,925
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

668
01:20:23,515 --> 01:20:27,102
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

669
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:30,021
At least a year.

670
01:20:30,146 --> 01:20:34,943
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

671
01:20:36,486 --> 01:20:40,323
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

672
01:20:46,162 --> 01:20:47,664
Take care.

673
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,210
Take care, Mike.

674
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:28,830
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

675
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:35,128
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

676
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:39,549
I want to straighten everything out.
don't want my father bothered again.

677
01:21:39,633 --> 01:21:42,886
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

678
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:47,182
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

679
01:21:47,265 --> 01:21:51,686
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

680
01:21:53,563 --> 01:21:55,231
He's a good kid.

681
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:02,697
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

682
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:06,868
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

683
01:22:11,998 --> 01:22:16,670
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

684
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:21,925
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

685
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,637
He's clean.

686
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:54,541
Going to Jersey?

687
01:22:57,043 --> 01:22:58,586
Maybe.

688
01:23:23,862 --> 01:23:25,655
Nice work, Lou.

689
01:24:02,817 --> 01:24:08,364
-How's the food in this restaurant?
-Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

690
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:10,116
I'll have it.

691
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:48,863
-I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
-Go ahead.

692
01:26:08,484 --> 01:26:10,153
What I want...

693
01:26:11,112 --> 01:26:13,281
What's most important to me

694
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:20,246
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

695
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:25,084
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

696
01:26:25,168 --> 01:26:28,713
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

697
01:26:28,796 --> 01:26:30,632
I'm not that clever.

698
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:34,385
All I want is a truce.

699
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:44,771
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

700
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:48,650
When you got to go, you got to go.

701
01:26:54,155 --> 01:26:56,074
He's clean.

702
01:26:56,157 --> 01:26:58,243
Don't take too long.

703
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:03,164
I've frisked a thousand punks.

704
01:31:53,788 --> 01:31:55,790
Okay, you take over.

705
01:32:13,057 --> 01:32:14,892
I love you, Grandpa.

706
01:32:17,812 --> 01:32:20,523
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

707
01:32:21,857 --> 01:32:24,944
-Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
-Okay.

708
01:32:25,069 --> 01:32:31,325
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank. "

709
01:32:34,328 --> 01:32:36,622
Go with your mother.

710
01:32:36,706 --> 01:32:38,833
Take them downstairs.

711
01:32:44,964 --> 01:32:47,008
Go on, Carlo, you too.

712
01:32:48,718 --> 01:32:50,428
Go on.

713
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:15,036
-What's the matter with you, Carlo?
-Shut up and set the table.

714
01:33:30,593 --> 01:33:36,641
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

715
01:33:38,392 --> 01:33:43,272
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

716
01:33:43,356 --> 01:33:46,859
They hit us, so we hit them back.

717
01:33:47,693 --> 01:33:52,239
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

718
01:33:52,323 --> 01:33:56,619
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

719
01:33:56,702 --> 01:33:58,829
So things are loosening up.

720
01:34:00,081 --> 01:34:04,835
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

721
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:07,463
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

722
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:12,093
-I want him to rest.
-I'm going to learn the casino business.

723
01:34:20,434 --> 01:34:22,228
Where's Michael?

724
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:37,660
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

725
01:34:39,453 --> 01:34:43,290
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

726
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:07,064
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

727
01:35:07,148 --> 01:35:09,108
I want him now.

728
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:17,533
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

729
01:35:17,616 --> 01:35:23,622
-He must get better first. I'll decide...
-War is costly. We can't do business.

730
01:35:23,706 --> 01:35:27,543
-Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
-We can't afford a stalemate.

731
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:32,590
-No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
-You're getting a great reputation!

732
01:35:32,715 --> 01:35:38,763
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!

733
01:35:38,846 --> 01:35:41,140
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

734
01:35:44,727 --> 01:35:47,021
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

735
01:35:48,189 --> 01:35:51,150
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

736
01:35:52,067 --> 01:35:56,447
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

737
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:00,701
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

738
01:36:00,785 --> 01:36:04,121
That's because
they've started making big money.

739
01:36:04,205 --> 01:36:07,500
Papa never talked business
at the table.

740
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:11,462
-Shut up, Connie...
-Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

741
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:13,297
Don't interfere.

742
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:19,512
I 'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

743
01:36:19,595 --> 01:36:22,389
We don't discuss business at the table.

744
01:37:09,603 --> 01:37:12,231
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

745
01:37:17,778 --> 01:37:19,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

746
01:37:20,447 --> 01:37:23,117
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

747
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,493
The bodyguards are here.

748
01:37:25,411 --> 01:37:26,745
It's still dangerous...

749
01:37:27,872 --> 01:37:29,623
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

750
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:33,294
Your enemies know you're here.

751
01:37:35,296 --> 01:37:37,047
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

752
01:37:37,715 --> 01:37:39,008
Not yet.

753
01:37:39,675 --> 01:37:41,510
It's out of the question.

754
01:37:44,972 --> 01:37:46,390
Where are you going now?

755
01:37:48,058 --> 01:37:49,101
To Corleone.

756
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:50,978
Take my car.

757
01:37:54,315 --> 01:37:55,357
I want to walk.

758
01:37:57,985 --> 01:37:59,153
Be careful.

759
01:38:33,687 --> 01:38:35,064
Where have all the men gone?

760
01:38:36,106 --> 01:38:38,317
They're all dead from vendettas.

761
01:38:39,944 --> 01:38:42,363
There are the names of the dead.

762
01:38:58,754 --> 01:39:02,883
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !

763
01:39:02,967 --> 01:39:07,262
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable!

764
01:39:07,388 --> 01:39:12,643
America! Take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

765
01:39:30,577 --> 01:39:32,621
Mamma mia what a beauty.

766
01:39:40,796 --> 01:39:43,882
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

767
01:39:50,097 --> 01:39:54,101
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

768
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:18,959
Did you have a good hunt?

769
01:40:19,918 --> 01:40:22,296
You know all the girls
around here?

770
01:40:22,796 --> 01:40:24,298
We saw some real beauties.

771
01:40:25,132 --> 01:40:28,635
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

772
01:40:31,847 --> 01:40:34,600
She would tempt the devil himself.

773
01:40:42,232 --> 01:40:44,401
Really put together.

774
01:40:44,485 --> 01:40:45,527
Right, Calo?

775
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:51,283
Such hair , such mouth!

776
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:56,830
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

777
01:40:57,372 --> 01:40:59,750
This one had a purple dress...

778
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:02,252
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

779
01:41:08,717 --> 01:41:10,552
Do you know her?

780
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:17,768
There's no girl like that
in this town.

781
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:21,688
My God, I understand!

782
01:41:25,818 --> 01:41:26,819
What's wrong?

783
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:30,405
Let's go.

784
01:41:32,366 --> 01:41:33,617
It's his daughter.

785
01:41:34,076 --> 01:41:35,577
Tell him to come here.

786
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:40,332
Call him.

787
01:42:00,394 --> 01:42:02,729
Fabrizio, you translate.

788
01:42:06,859 --> 01:42:08,735
I apologize if I offended you.

789
01:42:09,736 --> 01:42:13,157
I'm a stranger in this country.

790
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,326
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

791
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:24,668
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

792
01:42:26,086 --> 01:42:28,422
My name is Michael Corleone.

793
01:42:30,465 --> 01:42:34,595
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

794
01:42:36,763 --> 01:42:39,808
But then your daughter
would lose a father

795
01:42:41,393 --> 01:42:43,770
instead of gaining a husband.

796
01:42:51,945 --> 01:42:54,156
I want to meet your daughter.

797
01:42:54,823 --> 01:42:59,411
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

798
01:43:00,078 --> 01:43:01,747
With all respect.

799
01:43:07,794 --> 01:43:11,798
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

800
01:43:17,304 --> 01:43:18,805
What's her name?

801
01:46:14,147 --> 01:46:16,316
I'll knock you dizzy.

802
01:46:22,072 --> 01:46:24,157
Save it for the library.

803
01:46:27,828 --> 01:46:30,497
We've got to pick up my sister.

804
01:46:48,557 --> 01:46:50,267
What's the matter?

805
01:46:52,727 --> 01:46:54,521
What's the matter?

806
01:46:56,314 --> 01:46:58,233
-It was my fault!
-Where is he?

807
01:46:58,316 --> 01:47:01,486
It was my fault. I hit him.

808
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:05,365
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

809
01:47:10,579 --> 01:47:13,874
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

810
01:47:13,957 --> 01:47:16,460
Sonny, please don't do anything.

811
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,505
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

812
01:47:20,589 --> 01:47:23,467
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

813
01:47:28,013 --> 01:47:31,224
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

814
01:47:31,308 --> 01:47:33,977
Tell them to stop taking in action.

815
01:47:34,811 --> 01:47:36,521
We lost enough money last week.

816
01:47:43,653 --> 01:47:45,697
Come here, come here!

817
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:45,966
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

818
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:43,453
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

819
01:52:43,536 --> 01:52:47,874
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

820
01:52:47,957 --> 01:52:51,795
-I want to reach Michael.
-Nobody knows where he is.

821
01:52:51,878 --> 01:52:54,422
All we know is that he's all right.

822
01:52:56,966 --> 01:53:00,595
-What was that?
-An accident, but nobody was hurt.

823
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:05,850
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

824
01:53:07,393 --> 01:53:12,565
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

825
01:53:13,566 --> 01:53:15,443
He'll get in touch with you.

826
01:53:15,568 --> 01:53:19,239
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

827
01:53:19,322 --> 01:53:21,199
Come on. Sorry.

828
01:53:38,424 --> 01:53:43,096
<i>-Hello?
-Is Carlo there?</i>

829
01:53:43,888 --> 01:53:46,349
<i>-Who is this?
-A friend of Carlo.</i>

830
01:53:46,432 --> 01:53:49,811
<i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.</i>

831
01:53:55,567 --> 01:53:56,818
Bitch!

832
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:01,614
-Dinner's on the table.
-I'm not hungry.

833
01:54:01,698 --> 01:54:05,034
-The food is getting cold.
-I'll eat out later.

834
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:08,496
<i>-You just told me to make you dinner!
-Vafangool!</i>

835
01:54:08,705 --> 01:54:10,832
I'll vafangoolyou!

836
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:18,464
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

837
01:54:22,802 --> 01:54:27,140
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

838
01:54:36,357 --> 01:54:39,485
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

839
01:54:40,486 --> 01:54:42,155
Maybe I will.

840
01:54:48,912 --> 01:54:52,081
-Clean it up!
-Like hell I will!

841
01:54:52,165 --> 01:54:56,085
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

842
01:54:56,169 --> 01:55:00,673
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

843
01:55:00,757 --> 01:55:05,595
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

844
01:55:08,848 --> 01:55:10,558
Clean it!

845
01:55:10,642 --> 01:55:14,896
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer , like your father!

846
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:18,441
-All you Corleones are murderers!
-I hate you!

847
01:55:18,524 --> 01:55:20,234
Come on, kill me!

848
01:55:21,778 --> 01:55:23,446
Get out of here!

849
01:55:23,529 --> 01:55:26,950
-I hate you!
-Now I'll kill you.

850
01:55:27,033 --> 01:55:29,702
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

851
01:55:40,171 --> 01:55:43,132
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

852
01:55:44,258 --> 01:55:47,303
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

853
01:55:47,387 --> 01:55:50,306
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

854
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:53,393
Yeah, Connie.

855
01:55:58,064 --> 01:56:00,024
You wait there.

856
01:56:02,652 --> 01:56:05,196
No, you just wait there.

857
01:56:07,365 --> 01:56:09,617
Son -of-a -bitch.

858
01:56:09,701 --> 01:56:12,912
-Son -of-a -bitch!
-What's the matter?

859
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:20,169
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

860
01:56:28,177 --> 01:56:29,429
Sonny!

861
01:56:35,893 --> 01:56:37,895
-Sonny.
-Get out of here!

862
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:40,857
Go after him, go on!

863
01:57:10,595 --> 01:57:12,638
Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!

864
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:03,166
Give me a drop.

865
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:13,885
My wife is crying upstairs.

866
01:59:16,262 --> 01:59:18,764
I hear cars coming to the house.

867
01:59:23,436 --> 01:59:26,355
<i>Consigliere of mine,</i>

868
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:29,942
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

869
01:59:30,026 --> 01:59:32,403
I didn't tell Mama anything.

870
01:59:33,362 --> 01:59:36,616
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

871
01:59:40,119 --> 01:59:42,330
But you needed a drink first.

872
01:59:44,665 --> 01:59:45,917
Yeah.

873
01:59:49,212 --> 01:59:51,714
Well, now you've had your drink.

874
01:59:57,261 --> 02:00:01,140
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

875
02:00:18,199 --> 02:00:20,743
I want no inquiries made.

876
02:00:25,206 --> 02:00:27,750
I want no acts of vengeance.

877
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:32,296
I want you to arrange a meeting

878
02:00:33,297 --> 02:00:35,925
with the heads of the five families.

879
02:00:37,843 --> 02:00:39,929
This war stops now.

880
02:01:01,867 --> 02:01:04,412
Call Bonasera.

881
02:01:04,495 --> 02:01:06,664
I need him now.

882
02:01:19,051 --> 02:01:24,223
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

883
02:01:24,307 --> 02:01:26,684
You owe your Don a service.

884
02:01:26,767 --> 02:01:30,313
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

885
02:01:30,396 --> 02:01:34,734
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

886
02:01:55,921 --> 02:02:00,718
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

887
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:03,888
Yes. What do you want me to do?

888
02:02:20,905 --> 02:02:23,824
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

889
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,968
Look how they massacred my boy.

890
02:03:11,997 --> 02:03:15,251
It's safer to teach you English!

891
02:03:16,001 --> 02:03:17,420
I know English...

892
02:03:17,503 --> 02:03:22,299
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

893
02:03:29,515 --> 02:03:31,308
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

894
02:03:32,017 --> 02:03:34,019
How are things in Palermo?

895
02:03:40,025 --> 02:03:44,071
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

896
02:03:46,866 --> 02:03:48,701
How are things in Palermo?

897
02:03:49,076 --> 02:03:52,204
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

898
02:03:53,289 --> 02:03:56,667
times are changing for the worse.

899
02:03:58,919 --> 02:04:02,339
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

900
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:10,222
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

901
02:04:16,228 --> 02:04:17,396
What's wrong?

902
02:04:18,522 --> 02:04:20,733
Bad news from America.

903
02:04:23,194 --> 02:04:26,906
Your brother , Santino,
they killed him.

904
02:04:33,496 --> 02:04:35,331
Let's go...you promised.

905
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:55,142
Fabrizio!

906
02:04:55,226 --> 02:04:56,644
Get the car.

907
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:02,191
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

908
02:05:02,274 --> 02:05:05,861
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

909
02:05:05,945 --> 02:05:07,863
Okay, anything you say.

910
02:05:13,786 --> 02:05:15,538
Calo, where is Apollonia?

911
02:05:16,288 --> 02:05:19,792
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

912
02:05:22,086 --> 02:05:24,129
She'll make a good American wife.

913
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:28,133
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

914
02:05:38,394 --> 02:05:40,563
Fabrizio!

915
02:05:40,646 --> 02:05:42,314
Where are you going?

916
02:05:44,024 --> 02:05:46,443
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

917
02:05:52,575 --> 02:05:53,993
No, Apollonia!

918
02:06:17,057 --> 02:06:22,896
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

919
02:06:23,022 --> 02:06:27,860
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

920
02:06:29,612 --> 02:06:32,740
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

921
02:06:32,823 --> 02:06:36,160
and from Brooklyn

922
02:06:37,786 --> 02:06:39,872
Philip Tattaglia.

923
02:06:41,665 --> 02:06:44,376
And from Staten Island

924
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:47,963
we have with us Victor Strachi.

925
02:06:48,047 --> 02:06:53,677
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

926
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:57,514
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

927
02:07:04,355 --> 02:07:07,816
How did things ever get so far?

928
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,526
I don't know.

929
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:15,074
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

930
02:07:18,202 --> 02:07:21,622
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

931
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:27,503
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

932
02:07:27,586 --> 02:07:31,590
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

933
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:36,679
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

934
02:07:36,762 --> 02:07:42,142
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

935
02:07:42,226 --> 02:07:46,313
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

936
02:07:46,397 --> 02:07:50,609
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

937
02:07:50,693 --> 02:07:53,570
He refused to share them.

938
02:07:53,654 --> 02:07:57,449
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

939
02:07:57,533 --> 02:07:59,910
All of you know me.

940
02:08:00,828 --> 02:08:05,999
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

941
02:08:07,668 --> 02:08:13,507
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

942
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:17,845
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

943
02:08:17,928 --> 02:08:23,892
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

944
02:08:24,017 --> 02:08:28,731
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

945
02:08:28,814 --> 02:08:33,026
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

946
02:08:33,110 --> 02:08:38,240
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

947
02:08:38,323 --> 02:08:40,534
Times have changed.

948
02:08:40,659 --> 02:08:45,372
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

949
02:08:45,456 --> 02:08:48,333
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

950
02:08:48,417 --> 02:08:53,839
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

951
02:08:53,922 --> 02:08:58,510
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

952
02:08:59,595 --> 02:09:03,182
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

953
02:09:03,265 --> 02:09:05,851
After all, we're not communists.

954
02:09:08,979 --> 02:09:12,065
I also don't believe in drugs.

955
02:09:12,191 --> 02:09:17,029
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

956
02:09:17,112 --> 02:09:20,240
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

957
02:09:20,324 --> 02:09:23,577
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

958
02:09:23,869 --> 02:09:26,663
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

959
02:09:27,873 --> 02:09:33,796
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

960
02:09:33,879 --> 02:09:38,675
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

961
02:09:38,759 --> 02:09:40,552
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

962
02:09:41,887 --> 02:09:45,808
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

963
02:09:45,891 --> 02:09:49,102
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

964
02:09:55,734 --> 02:09:59,321
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

965
02:10:00,739 --> 02:10:07,371
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

966
02:10:07,913 --> 02:10:12,501
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

967
02:10:12,584 --> 02:10:16,880
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

968
02:10:16,964 --> 02:10:20,717
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

969
02:10:20,801 --> 02:10:24,096
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

970
02:10:24,179 --> 02:10:26,849
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

971
02:10:26,932 --> 02:10:32,062
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

972
02:10:32,145 --> 02:10:35,023
You talk about vengeance.

973
02:10:35,107 --> 02:10:38,360
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

974
02:10:38,443 --> 02:10:40,988
Or my boy to me?

975
02:10:41,071 --> 02:10:43,866
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

976
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:48,954
But I have selfish reasons.

977
02:10:51,248 --> 02:10:54,835
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

978
02:10:56,712 --> 02:10:59,256
because of this Sollozzo business.

979
02:11:00,799 --> 02:11:04,720
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

980
02:11:04,803 --> 02:11:07,472
Cleared of all these false charges.

981
02:11:08,891 --> 02:11:12,019
But I'm a superstitious man.

982
02:11:12,144 --> 02:11:17,441
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

983
02:11:18,817 --> 02:11:22,404
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

984
02:11:22,487 --> 02:11:25,365
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

985
02:11:26,658 --> 02:11:30,245
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

986
02:11:31,914 --> 02:11:34,249
And that I do not forgive.

987
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:39,087
But, that aside

988
02:11:42,174 --> 02:11:44,509
let me say that I swear

989
02:11:46,136 --> 02:11:49,264
on the souls of my grandchildren,

990
02:11:49,348 --> 02:11:53,727
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

991
02:12:19,211 --> 02:12:24,675
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

992
02:12:24,758 --> 02:12:26,885
Mention it. Don't insist.

993
02:12:28,887 --> 02:12:33,809
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

994
02:12:35,435 --> 02:12:37,396
Tattaglia's a pimp.

995
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:41,608
He could never have outfought Santino.

996
02:12:43,986 --> 02:12:49,574
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

997
02:13:05,048 --> 02:13:07,134
Come on, Nancy.

998
02:13:08,343 --> 02:13:10,929
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

999
02:13:12,264 --> 02:13:13,932
Okay, all right.

1000
02:13:27,029 --> 02:13:29,239
How long have you been back?

1001
02:13:30,032 --> 02:13:31,867
I've been back a year.

1002
02:13:33,285 --> 02:13:35,412
Longer than that, I think.

1003
02:13:38,248 --> 02:13:40,417
It's good to see you, Kay.

1004
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:54,014
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1005
02:13:56,516 --> 02:13:59,519
He's been sick. Very sick.

1006
02:14:01,063 --> 02:14:03,023
But you're not like him.

1007
02:14:03,106 --> 02:14:06,902
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1008
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:13,116
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1009
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,661
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1010
02:14:17,871 --> 02:14:20,290
Like a senator or president.

1011
02:14:20,373 --> 02:14:22,834
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1012
02:14:22,918 --> 02:14:25,754
They don't have men killed.

1013
02:14:29,174 --> 02:14:31,176
Who's being naive, Kay?

1014
02:14:32,427 --> 02:14:36,681
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1015
02:14:38,225 --> 02:14:42,604
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1016
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:48,401
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1017
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:52,989
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1018
02:14:54,282 --> 02:14:59,121
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1019
02:14:59,204 --> 02:15:02,707
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1020
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:06,628
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1021
02:15:08,338 --> 02:15:10,924
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1022
02:15:12,676 --> 02:15:16,555
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1023
02:15:18,223 --> 02:15:22,477
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1024
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:27,274
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1025
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:31,570
That we have children. Our children.

1026
02:15:33,071 --> 02:15:35,240
Kay, I need you.

1027
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:38,785
And I love you.

1028
02:16:00,932 --> 02:16:04,686
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1029
02:16:04,811 --> 02:16:08,440
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-Be patient.

1030
02:16:08,523 --> 02:16:11,651
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1031
02:16:11,735 --> 02:16:14,863
-Be patient.
-We must protect ourselves.

1032
02:16:14,946 --> 02:16:18,408
-Let me recruit some new men.
-No.

1033
02:16:18,491 --> 02:16:22,370
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-Mike, you're wrong.

1034
02:16:23,872 --> 02:16:26,041
Don Corleone...

1035
02:16:26,124 --> 02:16:30,253
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1036
02:16:30,337 --> 02:16:34,382
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1037
02:16:35,383 --> 02:16:38,053
Michael is now head of the family.

1038
02:16:38,136 --> 02:16:42,432
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1039
02:16:42,515 --> 02:16:44,893
After we make the move to Nevada

1040
02:16:44,976 --> 02:16:49,397
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1041
02:16:49,481 --> 02:16:53,818
-How long will that be?
-Six months.

1042
02:16:53,902 --> 02:16:57,155
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1043
02:16:57,239 --> 02:17:00,075
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1044
02:17:00,158 --> 02:17:05,830
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1045
02:17:05,914 --> 02:17:08,833
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1046
02:17:08,917 --> 02:17:11,836
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1047
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,173
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1048
02:17:20,095 --> 02:17:25,433
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1049
02:17:25,517 --> 02:17:27,852
That's all I can tell you now.

1050
02:17:28,687 --> 02:17:31,273
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1051
02:17:31,356 --> 02:17:34,734
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1052
02:17:34,818 --> 02:17:39,614
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1053
02:17:39,698 --> 02:17:42,242
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1054
02:17:42,325 --> 02:17:47,038
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1055
02:18:07,058 --> 02:18:10,895
-Thank you, Papa.
-I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1056
02:18:10,979 --> 02:18:13,898
Mike... Why am I out?

1057
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:18,111
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1058
02:18:19,404 --> 02:18:22,657
Things may get rough with the move.

1059
02:18:22,741 --> 02:18:24,034
Tom.

1060
02:18:29,205 --> 02:18:34,377
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1061
02:18:34,461 --> 02:18:38,590
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1062
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:43,261
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1063
02:18:44,262 --> 02:18:49,225
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1064
02:18:50,268 --> 02:18:53,313
-Maybe I could help.
-You're out, Tom.

1065
02:19:42,487 --> 02:19:46,783
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1066
02:19:46,908 --> 02:19:51,496
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1067
02:19:51,579 --> 02:19:55,708
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1068
02:19:55,792 --> 02:19:58,169
Let me open the door , all right?

1069
02:20:04,342 --> 02:20:09,764
-Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
-All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1070
02:20:09,848 --> 02:20:12,475
-Your brother Freddy.
-Girls?

1071
02:20:16,396 --> 02:20:19,482
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1072
02:20:20,692 --> 02:20:24,195
-Anything you want, kid, anything.
-Who are the girls?

1073
02:20:25,613 --> 02:20:29,033
-That's for you to find out.
-Get rid of them, Fredo.

1074
02:20:30,577 --> 02:20:35,248
-Hey, Mike...
-I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1075
02:20:35,331 --> 02:20:38,001
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1076
02:20:43,882 --> 02:20:47,177
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1077
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:49,387
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1078
02:20:51,097 --> 02:20:53,224
Hey, come on! Scram!

1079
02:20:54,893 --> 02:20:58,438
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1080
02:20:58,521 --> 02:20:59,814
Sorry.

1081
02:21:01,774 --> 02:21:04,319
I don't know. He's tired.

1082
02:21:14,496 --> 02:21:18,833
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1083
02:21:18,917 --> 02:21:20,877
Well, give him a call.

1084
02:21:22,253 --> 02:21:25,381
-Johnny, how are you?
-Nice to see you, Mike.

1085
02:21:25,465 --> 02:21:27,675
-We're proud of you.
-Thanks.

1086
02:21:27,759 --> 02:21:31,346
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1087
02:21:31,429 --> 02:21:33,681
Well, I owe it all to him.

1088
02:21:34,891 --> 02:21:36,476
He knows how grateful you are.

1089
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:39,812
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1090
02:21:39,896 --> 02:21:41,814
Mike, what can I do?

1091
02:21:42,982 --> 02:21:45,443
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1092
02:21:45,527 --> 02:21:48,446
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1093
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:54,619
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1094
02:21:54,702 --> 02:21:57,455
-Tom!
-Are you sure?

1095
02:21:57,539 --> 02:22:00,542
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1096
02:22:00,625 --> 02:22:03,336
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1097
02:22:04,629 --> 02:22:07,048
See, Johnny...

1098
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:11,344
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1099
02:22:11,427 --> 02:22:15,181
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1100
02:22:18,101 --> 02:22:22,730
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1101
02:22:23,982 --> 02:22:26,109
We're counting on you.

1102
02:22:28,111 --> 02:22:31,781
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1103
02:22:31,864 --> 02:22:33,157
Good.

1104
02:22:34,784 --> 02:22:39,414
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1105
02:22:39,497 --> 02:22:42,041
-Good to see you.
-How are you, Moe?

1106
02:22:42,166 --> 02:22:47,255
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1107
02:22:47,338 --> 02:22:50,925
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1108
02:22:53,595 --> 02:22:56,347
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1109
02:22:58,099 --> 02:22:59,934
Buy me out?

1110
02:23:00,018 --> 02:23:02,604
The casino, the hotel.

1111
02:23:02,687 --> 02:23:05,607
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1112
02:23:05,690 --> 02:23:11,112
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1113
02:23:11,195 --> 02:23:14,616
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1114
02:23:14,699 --> 02:23:18,578
-You think I'm skimming off the top?
-You're unlucky.

1115
02:23:23,374 --> 02:23:25,793
You Guineas make me laugh.

1116
02:23:25,918 --> 02:23:30,506
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1117
02:23:31,883 --> 02:23:35,303
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1118
02:23:35,386 --> 02:23:40,642
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1119
02:23:40,725 --> 02:23:43,478
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1120
02:23:43,561 --> 02:23:46,022
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1121
02:23:46,147 --> 02:23:50,526
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1122
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:54,530
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1123
02:23:54,614 --> 02:23:59,661
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1124
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:03,247
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1125
02:24:03,331 --> 02:24:08,169
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1126
02:24:08,252 --> 02:24:12,465
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1127
02:24:12,548 --> 02:24:17,303
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1128
02:24:21,349 --> 02:24:24,185
You straightened my brother out?

1129
02:24:24,268 --> 02:24:28,731
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1130
02:24:28,815 --> 02:24:30,775
What's wrong with you?

1131
02:24:35,655 --> 02:24:38,783
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1132
02:24:39,701 --> 02:24:41,327
Son -of-a -bitch!

1133
02:24:41,411 --> 02:24:46,582
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1134
02:24:46,666 --> 02:24:49,168
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1135
02:24:50,294 --> 02:24:53,840
<i>Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...</i>

1136
02:24:53,965 --> 02:24:59,345
Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1137
02:24:59,429 --> 02:25:02,765
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1138
02:25:07,645 --> 02:25:12,483
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1139
02:25:13,234 --> 02:25:14,444
Fredo...

1140
02:25:15,653 --> 02:25:18,406
You're my older brother , and I love you.

1141
02:25:19,866 --> 02:25:23,870
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1142
02:25:25,371 --> 02:25:26,372
Ever.

1143
02:25:34,505 --> 02:25:38,676
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1144
02:25:40,428 --> 02:25:45,308
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1145
02:25:52,690 --> 02:25:55,735
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1146
02:25:55,818 --> 02:25:57,945
-Let her ask.
-She's afraid to.

1147
02:25:58,029 --> 02:26:00,990
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1148
02:26:01,073 --> 02:26:02,909
-We'll see.
-Will you?

1149
02:26:02,992 --> 02:26:05,328
Let me think about it. Come on.

1150
02:26:14,212 --> 02:26:17,089
Barzini will move against you first.

1151
02:26:17,173 --> 02:26:21,594
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1152
02:26:21,677 --> 02:26:23,721
Guaranteeing your safety.

1153
02:26:24,972 --> 02:26:28,059
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1154
02:26:32,772 --> 02:26:35,775
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1155
02:26:37,193 --> 02:26:40,696
-Anyway, I'm drinking more.
-It's good for you, Pop.

1156
02:26:45,743 --> 02:26:47,245
I don't know.

1157
02:26:49,288 --> 02:26:52,208
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1158
02:26:53,167 --> 02:26:56,003
-Very happy.
-That's good.

1159
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:02,760
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1160
02:27:02,844 --> 02:27:05,805
-No, not at all.
-It's an old habit.

1161
02:27:07,265 --> 02:27:10,268
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1162
02:27:11,811 --> 02:27:15,273
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1163
02:27:18,609 --> 02:27:20,945
-How's your boy?
-He's good.

1164
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:23,781
He looks more like you every day.

1165
02:27:26,492 --> 02:27:30,955
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1166
02:27:33,082 --> 02:27:35,126
Read the funny papers.

1167
02:27:42,341 --> 02:27:47,972
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in - and out -going calls.

1168
02:27:48,097 --> 02:27:53,394
-I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
-That's right. I forgot.

1169
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:59,150
What's the matter?

1170
02:27:59,984 --> 02:28:02,028
What's bothering you?

1171
02:28:05,615 --> 02:28:10,244
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1172
02:28:23,507 --> 02:28:28,012
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1173
02:28:28,095 --> 02:28:29,722
And Fredo...

1174
02:28:32,433 --> 02:28:34,477
Fredo was, well...

1175
02:28:36,354 --> 02:28:39,190
But I never wanted this for you.

1176
02:28:41,525 --> 02:28:46,572
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1177
02:28:46,656 --> 02:28:50,576
And I refused to be a fool,

1178
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:54,789
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1179
02:28:56,749 --> 02:29:00,211
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1180
02:29:01,879 --> 02:29:07,051
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1181
02:29:08,844 --> 02:29:14,517
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1182
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:17,603
<i>Another pezzonovante.</i>

1183
02:29:17,687 --> 02:29:19,355
Well...

1184
02:29:22,566 --> 02:29:26,487
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1185
02:29:26,570 --> 02:29:30,074
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1186
02:29:34,912 --> 02:29:39,375
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1187
02:29:39,458 --> 02:29:42,420
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1188
02:29:59,395 --> 02:30:01,522
Can I hold it, please?

1189
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:20,499
-Can I water these?
-Yes, go ahead.

1190
02:30:20,583 --> 02:30:23,377
Over here, over here.

1191
02:30:25,254 --> 02:30:27,757
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1192
02:30:34,138 --> 02:30:35,890
Anthony!

1193
02:30:35,973 --> 02:30:37,641
Come here, come here.

1194
02:30:42,813 --> 02:30:45,483
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1195
02:30:50,696 --> 02:30:53,282
I'll show you something. Come here.

1196
02:30:55,326 --> 02:30:57,203
Stand there.

1197
02:31:00,956 --> 02:31:02,708
Give me an orange!

1198
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:22,853
That's a new trick.

1199
02:31:23,854 --> 02:31:26,190
You run in there. Run in there.

1200
02:31:39,745 --> 02:31:41,705
Where are you?

1201
02:34:39,383 --> 02:34:41,760
Mike, can I have a minute?

1202
02:34:51,854 --> 02:34:54,315
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1203
02:34:54,398 --> 02:34:57,693
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1204
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:00,571
-You talked to him?
-Yeah.

1205
02:35:01,905 --> 02:35:05,701
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1206
02:35:08,746 --> 02:35:11,290
-All right?
-All right.

1207
02:35:28,807 --> 02:35:31,769
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1208
02:35:34,271 --> 02:35:37,941
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1209
02:35:40,110 --> 02:35:41,904
Where I'll be safe.

1210
02:35:54,166 --> 02:35:57,753
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1211
02:35:57,836 --> 02:36:01,632
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1212
02:36:03,884 --> 02:36:05,177
But I'm going to wait.

1213
02:36:05,844 --> 02:36:06,845
After the baptism.

1214
02:36:10,724 --> 02:36:14,311
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1215
02:36:14,395 --> 02:36:18,565
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1216
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:23,112
All the heads of the five families.

1217
02:38:44,086 --> 02:38:49,049
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father , Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1218
02:38:49,132 --> 02:38:50,300
I do.

1219
02:38:50,384 --> 02:38:53,887
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?</i>

1220
02:38:53,971 --> 02:38:54,972
<i>I do.</i>

1221
02:38:55,055 --> 02:38:59,101
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1222
02:38:59,184 --> 02:39:00,477
<i>I do.</i>

1223
02:40:06,043 --> 02:40:10,380
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1224
02:40:16,637 --> 02:40:17,888
I do renounce him.

1225
02:40:27,564 --> 02:40:28,982
And all his works?

1226
02:40:42,871 --> 02:40:43,914
I do renounce them.

1227
02:40:45,666 --> 02:40:46,917
Oh, God!

1228
02:40:49,836 --> 02:40:53,507
-And all his pomps?
-I do renounce them.

1229
02:41:13,568 --> 02:41:14,778
I will.

1230
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:27,416
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1231
02:41:41,638 --> 02:41:43,557
Kay!

1232
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:45,600
Kiss your godfather.

1233
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:14,087
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1234
02:42:14,171 --> 02:42:15,839
Everybody has to leave without us.

1235
02:42:15,922 --> 02:42:18,884
-Mike, it's our first vacation!
-Connie, please.

1236
02:42:19,009 --> 02:42:22,512
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1237
02:42:23,638 --> 02:42:26,016
I'll only be a couple of days.

1238
02:42:42,282 --> 02:42:44,493
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1239
02:42:46,661 --> 02:42:50,415
-I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
-I'm sure he will.

1240
02:42:58,215 --> 02:43:03,637
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car , so you two go on ahead.

1241
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:07,265
-That screws up my arrangements.
-That's what he said.

1242
02:43:07,349 --> 02:43:09,518
I can't go either , Sal.

1243
02:43:21,488 --> 02:43:25,408
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1244
02:43:27,077 --> 02:43:29,913
-He understands that.
-Excuse me, Sal.

1245
02:43:35,919 --> 02:43:38,380
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1246
02:43:39,548 --> 02:43:42,717
-For old times' sake?
-Can't do it, Sally.

1247
02:44:28,138 --> 02:44:30,974
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1248
02:44:35,854 --> 02:44:39,774
-Mike, you got it all wrong.
-You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1249
02:44:40,817 --> 02:44:44,738
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1250
02:44:44,821 --> 02:44:49,910
-You think that could fool a Corleone?
-I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1251
02:44:49,993 --> 02:44:52,704
-Please, don't do this.
-Sit down.

1252
02:44:55,373 --> 02:44:57,667
Don't do this to me, please.

1253
02:45:06,927 --> 02:45:08,678
Barzini is dead.

1254
02:45:10,805 --> 02:45:13,141
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1255
02:45:14,351 --> 02:45:15,852
Moe Greene.

1256
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:20,607
Strachi. Cuneo.

1257
02:45:22,567 --> 02:45:27,822
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1258
02:45:27,906 --> 02:45:29,699
Admit what you did.

1259
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:35,288
Get him a drink.

1260
02:45:41,586 --> 02:45:42,879
Come on.

1261
02:45:44,214 --> 02:45:46,633
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1262
02:45:46,716 --> 02:45:49,594
Do you think
I 'd make my sister a widow?

1263
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:53,431
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1264
02:46:00,355 --> 02:46:02,399
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1265
02:46:07,195 --> 02:46:11,032
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1266
02:46:12,117 --> 02:46:16,079
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1267
02:46:16,162 --> 02:46:17,789
Tom.

1268
02:46:21,918 --> 02:46:25,505
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1269
02:46:25,588 --> 02:46:28,174
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1270
02:46:29,426 --> 02:46:33,680
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1271
02:46:37,934 --> 02:46:39,978
Who approached you?

1272
02:46:41,271 --> 02:46:43,481
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1273
02:46:51,364 --> 02:46:53,074
It was Barzini.

1274
02:46:57,203 --> 02:46:58,788
Good.

1275
02:47:05,003 --> 02:47:09,049
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1276
02:47:09,132 --> 02:47:12,677
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1277
02:47:16,973 --> 02:47:19,517
-Mike...
-Get out of my sight.

1278
02:47:45,668 --> 02:47:47,295
Hello, Carlo.

1279
02:48:47,147 --> 02:48:50,275
-I'm trying to tell you...
-Mama, please!

1280
02:48:58,658 --> 02:49:00,743
Michael!

1281
02:49:00,827 --> 02:49:02,829
-What is it?
-Where is he?

1282
02:49:05,248 --> 02:49:10,378
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1283
02:49:10,461 --> 02:49:14,549
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1284
02:49:14,632 --> 02:49:17,719
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1285
02:49:17,802 --> 02:49:23,600
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1286
02:49:23,683 --> 02:49:25,310
Connie.

1287
02:49:27,562 --> 02:49:30,273
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1288
02:49:30,356 --> 02:49:33,193
He knew he was going to kill him.

1289
02:49:33,276 --> 02:49:38,615
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold -hearted bastard!

1290
02:49:38,698 --> 02:49:42,785
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1291
02:49:42,869 --> 02:49:45,622
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1292
02:49:55,298 --> 02:49:59,510
No! No, no...

1293
02:49:59,594 --> 02:50:02,972
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1294
02:50:24,118 --> 02:50:25,828
She's hysterical.

1295
02:50:30,375 --> 02:50:32,126
Hysterical.

1296
02:50:34,128 --> 02:50:35,838
Michael, is it true?

1297
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:41,511
-Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
-Is it true?

1298
02:50:41,594 --> 02:50:44,347
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1299
02:51:04,409 --> 02:51:05,910
All right.

1300
02:51:08,746 --> 02:51:10,498
This one time.

1301
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:17,797
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1302
02:51:23,886 --> 02:51:25,305
Is it true?

1303
02:51:29,392 --> 02:51:30,893
Is it?

1304
02:51:32,645 --> 02:51:34,022
No.

1305
02:51:47,952 --> 02:51:50,913
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1306
02:52:22,195 --> 02:52:23,905
Don Corleone.
